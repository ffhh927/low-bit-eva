"Most good interviewers will make an effort to establish and keep eye contact. Make sure that you do not find yourself looking down or away. If you wear glasses, be sure to buy the non-glare lenses.

"I lost both of my parents in a tragic car accident when I was five. Fortunately, at that age a child doesn't understand the finality of such an event. Many years later, at the age of twenty-three, I was planning my wedding to Sheldon, who came from a complete loving family, the type I expect. Sheldon and I had already bought our first home with a large, beautifully landscaped yard. As the date grew closer and we took ownership of the home, we began to clean, arrange inside and out. The day before our wedding we were putting the final touches to the yard. We were so pleased with the neatness of it all. But one plant puzzled us. A rosebush located just outside our front door, was completely barren of leaves or buds. It looked liked it might be dead, but since neither of us could be sure, we reluctantly decided to keep it for the time being. That same evening, after the dinner, I was too excited to sleep. Instead I decided I needed some quiet time to reflect on the wedding the next day. I went to the backyard and sat in the warm, clear, star-filled night. It was there that I realized the only thing missing from my wedding day would be my parents. There had been no time to think of this until now and the thought filled me with sadness. After all, every girl dreams of having her father walk her down the aisle and her mother there to comfort her anxiety. Alone in the yard, I began speaking to my mom and dad, just as if I had known they were listening. ""Give me a sign on my wedding day to let me know you're with me."" The next day Sheldon's excited voice repeatedly called my name. I rushed to join him at the front door. ""I can't believe what I'm about to show you!"" He stood aside. The barren rosebush had two huge roses in full bloom. There was no doubt in my mind that we were witnessing a miracle...a miracle of love. According to the passage, why did the rosebush confuse the writer?",Because it was difficult to take care of.,Because it had a sign of dying away.,Because it grew in a wrong place.,Because its leaves were always falling.,B

"When I was 12, I got a part-time job on a dairy farm, milking cows. We milked 65 cows twice a day. One day, I complained to my father about having to go milk those cows, saying it was tiring. He said, you know, boy, to work is a blessing. I looked at the men who'd worked harder. I had a feeling I had been told something really important, but it took many years before it sank in.  Back then, going to college was a rare privilege. My father told me if I'd picked something to study that I liked doing, I'd always look forward to my work. But he also added, even having a job you hate is better than not having a job at all. I wanted to be a farmer, but I joined a military program to help pay for college. And what started out as an obligation to the Army became a way of life that I had been devoted to for 37 years. In the late 1980s, during a visit to Bangladesh, I saw a woman with her baby on her back, breaking bricks with a hammer. I asked a local officer why they weren't using a machine to make the work easier. He told me a machine would put that lady out of work. And as bad as that woman's job was, it was enough to keep a small family alive. It reminded me of my father's words: to work is a blessing.  After seeing a lot of people like that woman in Bangladesh, I've come to believe that people without jobs are not free. They're victims of crime, poor health, and depression. People who have jobs can have a home, send their kids to school, develop a sense of pride, contribute to the good of the community and even help others. When we can work, we are free. We are blessed.

"Now we're always hearing about road accident, and when we're in a car we try to drive carefully, but how many of us take the same degree of care in our homes? Any large hospital will tell you the number of the accidents that happen in the home is almost the same as those on the road. One of the commonest and most dangerous causes of home accidents is wrong and careless use of electrical equipment. People will continue to use a loose plug or pull out a plug without first turning off the power. In spite of warnings, one will carry an electric heater into the bathroom when he is going to have a bath. Sometimes one forgets to cut off the power before mending a lamp or something else. All this will cause accidents. So the rule about anything that work by electricity is:Switch off before you touch anything and don't pretend you know when you actually don't. If you've got children in the house, it's always best to keep medicines of any kind out of their reach. Otherwise, they may be taken for candies or a new kind of drink. When there are older people living with you, you have to take particular care in a number of ways in order to make them safe and happy. Fire, of course, is always a risk. So, remember not to dry clothes in front of fires, or leave stoves in the middle of rooms where they can easily be knocked over. And don't forget to keep the children away from fire. Smoking, too, may cause fire. So you'd better give it up. Safety first may mean a little more time and care, but it may save you a lot of trouble. According to the writer, we try to drive carefully in a car while   _  .",we take the same degree of care in our homes,We don't care much about the accidents in large hospitals,We don't pay enough attention to home accidents,We seldom think a lot about the road accidents,C

One of the commonest and most dangerous causes of home accidents is wrong and careless use of electrical equipment. People will continue to use a loose plug or pull out a plug without first turning off the power. In spite of warnings, one will carry an electric heater into the bathroom when he is going to have a bath. Sometimes one forgets to cut off the power before mending a lamp or something else. All this will cause accidents. So the rule about anything that work by electricity is:Switch off before you touch anything and don't pretend you know when you actually don't. If you've got children in the house, it's always best to keep medicines of any kind out of their reach. Otherwise, they may be taken for candies or a new kind of drink. When there are older people living with you, you have to take particular care in a number of ways in order to make them safe and happy. Fire, of course, is always a risk. So, remember not to dry clothes in front of fires, or leave stoves in the middle of rooms where they can easily be knocked over. And don't forget to keep the children away from fire. Smoking, too, may cause fire. So you'd better give it up. Safety first may mean a little more time and care, but it may save you a lot of trouble. It can be inferred in the text that our life at home will be much safer if   _  .",we know more about the accidents that happen in the home,all of us give up smoking as soon as possible,we take more time and care in our life,we keep the stoves at the corner of the rooms,A

"A fierce earthquake struck HaitionJanuary 12, 2010, causing a crowded hospital to fall down and countless houses and buildings were destroyed. The earthquake, the worst in the region in more than 200 years, with a magnitude estimated at 7.0, struck just before 5 p.m. about 10 miles southwest of Port-au-Prince, leaving the region nearly in ruins. As night fell in Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, fires burned near the shoreline downtown, but otherwise the city fell into darkness. The electricity was out, telephones were not working and relief workers struggled to make their way through blocked streets. In this earthquake, it was not possible for officials to determine how many people had been killed and injured. It was reported that the headquarters of the United Nations mission was seriously damaged and many employees were missing. Part of the national palace had fallen to the ground. A hospital was totally ruined in Petionville, which is home to many diplomats  and wealthy Haitians. A New York reporter said that a wall at the front of the Hotel Oloffson had fallen, killing a passer-by. A number of nearby buildings was badly damaged, trapping people. People were screaming, calling for help from every corner. Haiti sits on a large fault between the much larger North American plate to the north and the Caribbean plate to the south. The earthquake on Tuesday happened when what appears to be part of the southern fault zone broke. With many poor people living in tin-roof shacks  and with many of the buildings in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere in the country of questionable quality, it was expected that the quake caused major damage to buildings and great loss of life. What was the damage of the earthquake?",The headquarters of the UN mission was totally destroyed.,Some of the national palace had fallen to the ground.,A hospital was partly ruined in Petionville.,All the walls of the Hotel Oloffson had fallen.,B

"An allowance is an important tool for teaching kids how to budget, save and make their own decisions. Children remember and learn from mistakes when their own dollars are lost or spent foolishly. How large an allowance is appropriate? Experts say there is not right amount. Actual amounts differ from region to region, and from family to family. To set an appropriate allowance for your child, work up a weekly budget. Allow for entertainment expenditures such as movies and snacks. Next, include everyday expenses such as lunch money, bus fare, school supplies. ""If you make the child responsible for these ' ills',"" says Josephine Swanson, a consumer specialist, "" he or she will learn to budget for necessary expenditures."" Finally, add some extra money to make saving possible. If you can, keep your child's allowance in line with that of his friends. A child whose purchasing power falls away below his peers' can feel left out. It can be tough, but avoid excusing your children when they make a mistake with their allowance. When Brooke Stephens was ten and growing up in Jacksonville, her mother gave her $5 a week, $1.75 of which was for bus fare and lunch."" If you lose your money,"" Brooke's mother told her, ""you walk home."" One week the girl spent all her allowance in a candy store, then she called home for a ride. "" Mom made me walk home,"" recalls Stephens, now a financial planner in Brooklyn. "" At first I was angry. But I finally realized that she was trying to teach me an important lesson. "" Experts advise that an allowance should not be tied directly to a child's daily chores. Kids should help around the house not because they get paid for it but because they share responsibilities as members of a family. You might, however, pay a child for doing extra jobs at home, which can develop his or her initiative.

"Scientists from England's Newcastle University have discovered that bacteria have the ability to detect smells, according to a study by the university on Sunday. The team of scientists, led by Dr. Reindert Nijland, discovered that bacteria can detect certain types of smell- producing chemicals, including  ammonia   that is produced by other bacteria. Once they sense the smells from other kinds of bacteria, the bacteria will gather together to form a colony   and form a layer of slime   in order to force the competitors out of their area. The response decreases as the distance between the two bacterial colonies increases. That slime, also known as biofilm, is one of the primary causes of infection on many medical implants . Biofilms also slow down ships and are believed to cost the marine industry millions of dollars annually. However, they can also be used to clean up spilled oil floating on the sea, as they grow strong on it. ""This is the first evidence of a bacterial 'nose'able to detect potential competitors,"" Dr. Nijland said in the August 15 statement, which confirms that bacteria possess qualities similar to four of the five senses that humans enjoy (sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell), the others being touch, taste, and sight. ""The fact that bacteria formed slime when exposed to ammonia has important significance for understanding how biofilms are formed and how we might be able to use them to our advantage,"" he added. Their findings were published in Sunday's edition of biotechnology journal, and could change the way scientists look at how each of the senses developed over time. ""It was thought for a long time that smell existed only in complex living creatures,"" Dr. Nijland said. ""Now we see that bacteria are able to do the same, so the indication is that the ability may have developed even earlier."" We learn from the text that biofilms   _  .",may cause oil to spill,can be used to benefit humans,are the major causes of infection,are more likely to be found on ships,B

Yawning, Annie nodded and smiled. The time was 4:30 a.m. Looking out into the darkness, Annie remembered learning in school that most owls are active at night, when they hunt for food. During the day they sleep in hard-to-find spots. ""Dad, why do you need to count owls?"" she asked. ""It's important for the scientists to have current information about bird populations,"" he explained. ""We want to know which birds have decreased in number and whether any new kinds of birds are coming into a certain area. You and I will write down the kinds of birds that we see today and keep a record of how many times we see each kind. The we'll send out a report to a scientific organization that is collecting about birds from people all over the county."" Dad pulled into the parking lot of the state park. Then, with flashing in hand, they began their hike into the woods. Annie zipped up her coat and tried to keep from trembling. She had not expected the morning to be so frigid. Luckily her gloves were in her pocket. Suddenly Annie's father stooped and gestured for her to be still. Obeying, Annie did not take another step. She thought she heard a low crying up head. ""That's certainly a screech owl,"" her father whispered. ""Let's get a look at it."" After looking more closely, Annie could see that it was a small owl. Sensing danger, the owl narrowed its eyes and pulled its feathers tightly against its body. Annie carefully wrote down in her notebook that they had seen a screech owl. Walking a little farther, they came to a tall oak tree. ""This looks like a perfect spot to attract owls,"" Dad said. ""I'm going to play a recording of common call of the barred owl. Maybe we can get one to answer.' Annie could hardly believe her ear. The recorded all sounded as if the bird were asking, ""who cooks for you?"" Moments later Annie thought she heard a return call in distance. She held her breath and waited. Suddenly a huge bird landed very quietly on a branch above them. Annie had long forgotten how cold it was. She stood in wonder, shining her flashlight on the bird and studying it carefully. The barred owl was nearly tow feet tall. Gray feathers surrounded its dark eyes. The bird did not matter. Annie would never forge the image of the powerful barred owl.

"Magic is believed to have begun with the Egyptians, in 1700 BC. A magician named Dedi of Dedsnefu was reported to have performed for the pharaoh, or the king. He was also known to have entertained the slaves who built the pyramids. The ""Cups and Balls"" trick which he was particularly good at is still performed by magicians all over the world today. The ancient Greeks and Romans were also fascinated by the idea of magic. Actually, one of their main interests was the art of deception . This explains why at that time the priests  even built magic devices into their temples. These devices made it possible for doors to open by themselves and wine to flow magically out of statues' mouths. This was done mainly to convince people that the priests were powerful. Magic, however, was not well accepted before the 1800s. Magicians were thought of as freaks  and were only allowed to perform in a circus . It was in the 19th century that the magician Robert Houdin came along and changed people's views and attitudes about magic.

"A recent survey shows that the alarming rate of child suicide  in Hong Kong, raising levels of stress and anxiety among young people, increasing conflicts between children and teachers, and children's complaints that their parents do not understand their problems--all point to a drop in ""emotional quotient"" (EQ)  , the ability to handle relationships. EQ is defined as the ability to deal with oneself and others effectively. High EQ, psychologists say, is easy to spot. Some of the greatest humanitarian   leaders have high EQ, along with successful managers and inspirational and respected teachers. The problem is not how to spot high EQ but to improve on low EQ, so society as a whole can benefit. In the United States, declining EQ among young people is seen as one of the factors behind rising young people's crime because youths fail to understand others' feelings--one of the key components of EQ. While the situation in Hong Kong is not so bad, there are warning signs that the levels of anxiety among youth may become critical. Declining EQ among Hong Kong teenagers has been acknowledged by several studies including a key study by the education concern group, the Learning-Teacher Association, which found a high degree of anxiety among students over the future and also that young people lacked confidence in dealing with problems. Parents and teachers will also need to develop their own EQ skills in order to deal with them effectively. Daniel Goleman cites a number of basic elements of high EQ: first, awareness of your feelings as you experience them which is very important to making good decisions in life; second, feeling or awareness of what others are feeling. ""90% of emotional information is expressed non-verbally and people vary in their ability to pick it up,"" Dr. Goleman says in his book. Dr. Goleman argues that without high EQ even highly-educated, highly-intelligent people will not find success in life. Or those with low EQ, even though they may be brilliant, tend to lack feeling and impulse control. They fail easily, and they are easily intolerant and often aggressive in interpersonal relations. Some educational psychologists believe work on EQ may be important in Hong Kong with _ high rate of suicide among school children.

"Women teachers are holding back boy students by blaming them for typically male behavior, according to a new study. Women teachers are always saying that boys are ""silly"" in class. They refuse to ""sit nicely like girls"" and are more likely to be addicted to ""schoolboy tricks"".Women teachers may also keep low expectations of boys' academic achievement and encourage girls to work harder by letting them think they are cleverer than boys. The study suggests that under-performance among boys in most national exams could be linked to lower expectations of their women teachers. The researchers did their research mainly on women teachers, since nearly 90 percent of primary school teachers are female. According to the research, women teachers said they often found boys' play in the classroom or in the playground, such as playing with toy guns. The researcher also found that boys were often punished and urged to follow a more feminine style of play instead of being taught how to play responsibly with their favorite toys by their women teachers. Bonny Hartley, the study's lead author, said, ""By seven or eight years old, children of both boys and girls believe that boys are less focused, less able, and less successful than girls -- and think that adults admit this idea. There are signs that these expectations have the potential to become self-fulfilling in influencing children's achievement. Boys are really held back by their women teachers."" Which can be the best title for the passage?",Boys are less clever than girls in school.,The best way to deal with naughty boys.,Women teachers should be patient to boys.,Boys are held back by women teachers.,D

According to the research, women teachers said they often found boys' play in the classroom or in the playground, such as playing with toy guns. The researcher also found that boys were often punished and urged to follow a more feminine style of play instead of being taught how to play responsibly with their favorite toys by their women teachers. Bonny Hartley, the study's lead author, said, ""By seven or eight years old, children of both boys and girls believe that boys are less focused, less able, and less successful than girls -- and think that adults admit this idea. There are signs that these expectations have the potential to become self-fulfilling in influencing children's achievement. Boys are really held back by their women teachers."" What is the women teachers' attitude towards the boys?",They encourage boys to work harder at their lessons.,They keep the same expectations of boys and girls.,They are always thinking that boys are silly in class.,They think boys are cleverer than girls in their studies.,C
"Women teachers are holding back boy students by blaming them for typically male behavior, according to a new study. Women teachers are always saying that boys are ""silly"" in class. They refuse to ""sit nicely like girls"" and are more likely to be addicted to ""schoolboy tricks"".Women teachers may also keep low expectations of boys' academic achievement and encourage girls to work harder by letting them think they are cleverer than boys.

"There was great excitement on the planet of Venus   . Venusian scientists managed to land a satellite on the planet Earth, and it has been sending back signals as well as photographs ever since. The satellite was directed into an area known as Manhattan, named after the great Venusian astronomer Professor. Manhattan, who first discovered it with his telescope 20000 light years ago. Because of excellent weather conditions and extremely strong signals, Venusian scientists were able to get valuable information as to feasibility   of a manned flying saucer landing on Earth. A press conference was held at the Venus Institute of Technology. ""We have come to the conclusion, based on last week's satellite landing,"" Prof. Zog said, ""that there is no life on Earth.""

For another, the atmosphere is filled with carbon monoxide   and other deadly gases and nobody could possibly breathe this air and survive."" ""What does this mean as far as our flying saucer program is concerned?"" ""We shall have to take our own oxygen with us, which means a much heavier flying saucer than originally planned."" ""Are there any other dangers that you discovered in your studies?"" ""Take a look at this photo. You see this dark black cloud hovering   over the surface of Earth?

""Over here you will notice what seems to be a river, but the satellite findings indicates it is polluted and the water is unfit to drink.

"After 21 years of marriage, my wife wanted me to take another woman out to dinner and a movie. The other woman my wife wanted me to visit was my mother, who has been a widow  for 19 years, but the demands of my work and my three children had made it impossible to visit her often. That Friday after work, when I arrived at her house, my mother waited in the door with her coat on. She had curled her hair and was wearing the dress that she had worn to celebrate her last wedding anniversary.  We went to a restaurant that, although not elegant, was very nice and comfortable. My mother took my arm as if she were the First Lady. During the dinner, we had an agreeable conversation, nothing extraordinary but catching up on recent events of each other's life. We talked so much that we missed the movie. As we arrived at her house later, she said, ""I'll go out with you again, but only if you let me invite you."" I agreed. A few days later, my mother died of a massive heart attack. It happened so suddenly that I didn't have a chance to do anything for her. Some time later, I received an envelope with a copy of a restaurant receipt from the same place Mother and I had dined. An attached note said ""I paid this bill in advance. I wasn't sure that I could be there; but, nevertheless, I paid for two plates--one for you and the other for your wife. You w ill never know what that night meant for me. I love you, son."" At that moment, I understood the importance of saying in time 'I love YOU' and to give our loved ones the time that they deserve. Nothing in life is more important than your family. Give them the time they deserve because these things cannot be put off till some ""other"" time.

"Last year in my high school child-development class,each student had to take the ""Think-It-Over"" baby home for a night to get a taste of parenthood.

"Life is to be enjoyed. There's no point in giving up something you enjoy unless you get something back that's even better. When people eat more healthfully, exercise, quit smoking, and manage stress better, they find that they feel so much better that it reconstructs the reason for making these changes from fear of dying to joy of living. The latest studies show that when you exercise and eat right: YOUR BRAIN receives more blood flow and oxygen, so you become smarter, think more clearly, have more energy, and need less sleep. Two studies showed that just walking for three hours per week for only three months caused so many new neurons   to grow that it actually increased the size of people's brains! YOUR FACE receives more blood flow, so your skin glows more and wrinkles less. You look younger and more attractive. In contrast, an unhealthy diet, chronic emotional stress and smoking reduce blood flow to your face so you age more quickly. Smoking accelerates aging because nicotine causes your arteries   to narrow down, which decreases blood flow to your face and makes it wrinkle earlier. This is why smokers look years older than they really are. YOUR GENES change. In May, a study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showing that changing your lifestyle changes your genes. YOUR TELOMERES   get longer. Telomeres are the ends of our chromosomes   that control how long we live. As telomeres become shorter, then cells age more quickly, thus shortening your life. Besides, one of the most interesting findings in the study was that the mothers' awareness of stress was more important than what was really occurring in their lives. The researchers gave the women a questionnaire and asked them to rate on a three-point scale how stressed they felt each day, and how out of control their lives felt to them. The women who were aware that they were under heavy stress had significantly shortened and damaged telomeres compared with those who felt more relaxed. On the contrary, some of the women who felt relaxed despite raising a disabled child had more normal-appearing telomeres. In other words, if you feel stressed, you are stressed; if you feel fine, you are fine. In the author's opinion, when you exercise and eat right, you will experience some changes EXCEPT   _  .",brains becoming cleverer,faces having fewer wrinkles,arteries turning narrower,genes being changed,C

"If you want to know how crazy people can be about their pets, you might remember that Helmsley left $12 million to her little Maltese dog when she died last year. The dog's name is Trouble. And apparendy Trouble is still alive. Of course, I would hang on,too, if someone left me $12 million. Look! Top-shelf dog food, soft pillows everywhere, drivers walking me in nice leafy parks. I would live to be 110 in dog years. The dog's story is still fresh in my mind the other night when I leave a steak house after a superb meal. Then I notice a woman carrying a small bag out of the door behind me. Once outside, she walks over to where a man is holding a tiny dog hke it's a baby. The dog looks like a Maltese, too, barking and annoying, with a cute haircut, And now I am treated to an absolute astonishing sight. Because now the woman reaches into the bag and begins pulling out little pieces of meat, which she puts on a plastic spoon and feeds to the dog. This is no cheap steak house. It's actually, way out of my league --I'm there only because it's a special occasion. I can tell you this: if I walked out of the place with any leftover steak, it sure wouldn't go to a dog. Not at those prices. So now the woman is Spoon-feeding the dog and the man is just standing there, holding this dog and looking as if this is the most normal thing in the world. And the dog is calmly chewing these pieces of steak as if he's a little king. And this dog is in no hurry. He's having a great time. A few minutes go by, and now the dog finishes all of his steak. At this point, I hear the woman say to the man ""Think he's still hungry?"" And she glances behind her at the restaurant, as if she might go back in there to get more steak for the dog.

"Three Yale University professors agreed in a discussion that the automobile was what one of them called ""Public Health Enemy No. 1 in this century"". Besides polluting the air and overcrowding the cities, cars are involved in more than half the disastrous accidents, and they contribute to heart disease ""because we won't walk anywhere any more,"" said Richard Weeinaman, professor of medicine and public health. Speaking of many of those man-made dangers of the automobile, Arthur W. Galson, professor of biology, said it was possible to make a kerosene-burning turbine car that would ""lessensmog by a very large factor"". But he expressed doubt whether Americans were willing to give up moving about the countryside at 90 miles per hour in a large vehicle. ""America seems wedded to the motor car--every family has to have at least two, and one has to be a convertible   with 300 horsepower,"" professor Galson continued. ""Is this the way of life that we choose because we treasure these values?"" For professor Sears, part of the blame lies with ""a society that regards profit as a supreme value, under the illusion that anything that's technically possible is, therefore, morally justified"". Professor Sears also called the country's dependence on its modern automobiles ""terrible economics"" because of the large horsepower used simply ""moving one individual to work"". But he admitted that Americans have painted themselves into a corner by allowing the national economy to become so dependent on the automobile industry. ""The solution,"" Dr Weeinerman said, ""is not finding a less dangerous fuel but a different system of inner city transportation.

"Thanks to the Internet, a whole new online world has been opened up for us to meet, chat and go where we've never been before. But just as in face to face communication, there are some rules of behavior that should be followed when on line.  The basic rule is simple: treat others in the same way you would want to be treated.   Imagine how you'd feel if you were in the other person's shoes. For anything you're about to send: ask yourself, ""Would I say this to the person's face?"" if the answer is no, rewrite and reread.  Repeat the process till you feel sure that you'd feel comfortable saying words to a person's  face. If someone in the chat room is rude to you, your instinct   is to fire back in the same manner. But try not to do so.  Just pay no attention to it, or block his message.  If it was caused by a disagreement with another member, try to fix the situation by politely discussing it. Remember to respect the beliefs and opinions of others in the chat room. Everyone was new to the network once.  Offer advice when asked by newcomers, as they may not be sure what to do or how to communicate. When someone makes a mistake, whether it's a stupid question or an unnecessarily long answer, be kind about it. If it's a small mistake, you may not need to say anything. Even if you feel strongly about it, think twice before saying anything. Having good manners yourself doesn't give you license to correct everyone else. If you do decide to tell someone about a mistake, point it out politely At the same time, if you find you are wrong, be sure to correct yourself and apologize to those that you have offended. It is not polite to ask others personal questions such as their age, sex and marital status. Unless you know the person very well, and you are both comfortable with sharing personal information, don't ask such questions. When you send short messages to a person, you must   _  .",make sure they mean no harm,read them again and again,say something good to hear,repeat them later to his face,A

For anything you're about to send: ask yourself, ""Would I say this to the person's face?"" if the answer is no, rewrite and reread.

"I am a strong believer that if a child is raised with approval he learns to love himself and will be successful in his own way. Several weeks ago, I was doing homework with my son in the third grade and he kept standing up from his chair. I kept asking him to sit down, telling him that he would concentrate better. He sat but seconds later, as if he didn't even notice he was doing it, he got up again. I was getting annoyed, but then it hit me: I started noticing his answers were much quicker and right when he stood up. Could he be focused while standing up? This made me start questioning myself and what I had been raised to believe. I was raised to believe that a quiet child was more likely to succeed. This child would have the discipline to study hard, get good grades and become someone important in life. Kids that were active and loud would only be objects of stares. Now people perhaps come to realize that their kids are born with their own sets of DNA and personality features, and all they can do is loving and accepting them. As parents, throughout their growing years and beyond that, we need to be our kids' best cheerleaders, guiding them and helping them find their way. I have stopped asking my son to sit down and concentrate. Obviously, he is concentrating, just in his own way and not mine. We need to accept our kids, and their ways of doing things. This way may have worked for me but doesn't mean we need to carry it through generations. There is nothing sweeter than seeing our children being individual . It makes us happy and that's just the way I want my kids to live life. According to the passage, the author tried to keep his son seated so that   _  .",he could finish his homework on time,he couldn't bother the author,he could pay more attention to his study,he could keep silent in the room,C

"I have two kids, a boy and a girl. I don't worry about my girl; I'm sure she'll be well trained in mixed martial arts. I worry about my son. I'm pretty sure he's going to be feminine  . Sorry to say that, but let's face it. No dad wants his son to go feminine. At the rate we're moving in a couple of years you won't be able to tell the difference between boys and girls. Sound extreme? Think about this. In every movie where advanced time-traveling beings come to our planet, there's one constant: You can't tell the male aliens from the female aliens! But that's the future. Kids today are soft and fat. People ask why. Is it junk food? No. Junk food has been around for fifty years. Is it video games? No. Video games have been around for thirty years. None of the kids playing them back in the day were terribly obese. We're all scratching our heads trying to figure out what we've introduced to society to ruin our kids. But it's not anything we've added that has ruined our kids. It's stuff we've gotten rid of. Take the gym rope for example. Remember that thing that stretched from the floor to the ceiling in your gym class that you could never climb? Most of the kids couldn't make it to the top. But that wasn't the point; the point was you had to try while some middle-aged guy who couldn't make it up a flight of stairs shouted at you. We should have put our son on that rope, and given him a head start. But we didn't want to shame the boy, so we took it down. Taking down the rope would be a good idea if there were no ropes in life. But they're everywhere. You just can't see them. They're in every goal unrealized and expectation not met. The point everyone missed about the rope is you weren't supposed to make it to the top. It was there to create a fire that burned in the oversize belly of every kid. What is the example of aliens used to show?",Girls are growing like boys.,Boys are going feminine.,There are really time-traveling beings.,Alien movies are popular with children.,B

Our first stop at the Margaret Mitchell House is an exhibit area telling about the writer's life. She was born in Atlanta in 1900. She started writing stories when she was a child. She started working as a reporter for theAtlanta Journalnewspaper in 1922. One photograph of Ms. Mitchell, called Peggy, shows her talking to a group of young college boys. She was only about one and a half meters tall. The young men _ her, but she seems very happy and sure of herself. The tour guide explains: ""Now in this picture Peggy is interviewing some boys from Georgia Tech, asking them such questions as 'Would you really marry a woman who works?' And today it'd be 'Would you marry one who doesn't?' "" The Margaret Mitchell House is a building that once contained several apartments. Now we enter the first floor apartment where Ms. Mitchell lived with her husband, John Marsh. They made fun of the small apartment by calling it ""The Dump "" . Around 1926, Margaret Mitchell had stopped working as a reporter and was at home healing after an injury. Her husband brought her books to read from the library. She read so many books that he bought her a typewriter and said it was time for her to write her own book. Our guide saysGone with the Windbecame a huge success. Margaret Mitchell received the Pulitzer Prize for the book. In 1939 the film version was released. It won ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Which is the best title for the passage?",A Trip to Know Margaret Mitchell.,Gone with the Wind: A Huge Success.,An Introduction of the Margaret Mitchell House.,Margaret Mitchell: A Great Female Writer.,A

"Humans and many other mammals have unusually efficient internal temperature regulating systems that automatically maintain stable core body temperatures in cold winters and warm summers. In addition, people have developed cultural patterns and technologies that help them adjust to extremes of temperature and humidity . In very cold climates, there is a constant danger of developing hypothermia , which is a life threatening drop in core body temperature to below normal levels. The normal temperature for humans is about 37.0degC. However, differences in persons and even the time of day can cause it to be as much as 6degC higher or lower in healthy individuals. It is also normal for core body temperature to be lower in elderly people. Hypothermia begins to occur when the core body temperature drops to 34.4degC. Below 29.4degC, the body cools more rapidly because its natural temperature regulating system usually fails. The rapid decline in core body temperature is likely to result in death. However, there have been rare cases in which people have been saved after their temperatures had dropped to 13.9-15.6degC. This happened in 1999 to a Swedish woman who was trapped under an ice sheet in freezing water for 80 minutes. She was found unconscious, not breathing, and her heart had stopped beating, yet she was eventually saved despite the fact that her temperature had dropped to 13.7degC. In extremely hot climates or as a result of uncontrollable infections, core body temperatures can rise to equally dangerous levels. This is hyperthermia. Life threatening hyperthermia typically starts in humans when their temperatures rise to 40.6-41.7degC. Only a few days at this extraordinarily high temperature level is likely to result in the worsening of internal organs and death. Why can humans keep stable body temperatures in different seasons?",Because their bodies are unusually efficient.,Because they experience different climates.,Because they can adjust to cultural patterns and technologies.,Because they have internal temperature regulating systems.,D

"In a recent class I was asked ""What is a short story?""

My favorite is Benet's: ""something that can be read in an hour and remembered for a lifetime"". One writer said, ""The theme of a novel won't fit into the framework of a short story; It's like trying to squeeze a large painting done on a wall into the frame of a miniature  .  And as in a miniature painting, the details need to be sharp. "" The short story is an example of one aspect of human nature. Often a character _ some event, something that offers him or her change. This is why it's said that short stories usually ""say something "", often a small something, but sometimes delivered with such accuracy that the effect is strongly felt, even a life-moment for some readers, something similar to a religious experience or to witnessing a never-to-be-repeated scene in nature. Ok, let's form a definition here: A short story is an account, rarely over 10, 000 words or below 500 words-more commonly 1, 500 to 5, 000 words-a single-sitting read, but with enough time and weight to move the reader. It is narrow and focused to produce an effect through the story, most commonly through events affecting some change in an individual.

"Only after the straight-talking repairman handed me the bill and waved goodbye did I finally acknowledge the painful truth: Our 20-year-old clothes dryer was not going to last. I turned to my husband. ""He says we're throwing good money after bad,"" I sighed. ""I think he's right."" ""When do you want to go shopping for a new one?"" my husband asked. I glanced out the window, admiring the sunlight dancing on the big-leaf maples  in our backyard. Perfect drying weather. Suddenly, I recalled my mother hanging laundry on a clothesline during my childhood. My sister and I had played hide-and-seek among the sweet-smelling sheets waving in the wind. I suddenly had a plan. After the wash cycle, we covered the maples with damp blue jeans, shirts, socks and towels. The only things that didn't go outside were my underpants. And I persuaded my shameless husband to let his big boxer shorts  stay indoors, too. There is a secret pleasure to hanging laundry outdoors. It is the perfect excuse to get up from the computer. While checking on the laundry in the backyard, I could commune  not only with cotton T-shirts, but also my cats. I could watch cautious deer run through the yard with their young, listen to nervous squirrels in trees and observe a family of wild turkeys by the road. I returned to my desk refreshed. And, except for the sandpaper feel of sun-dried bath towels, the drying method was a complete success. When autumn came, I'd scan the horizon each day to evaluate the chances of sun-drying. One morning I saw rain clouds. I had a load of wet clothes in my arms and no place to put them. I found my husband. Together we hung laundry throughout the house. Then my husband gave me a hug and a smile. ""I think it's time to buy a dryer..."" he said, ""... like, today."" ""Good idea,"" I said, just as the infamous Oregon rain started. Our sun-dried laundry habit was finished for the season. What was the biggest benefit that sun-drying brought to the author besides dry clothes?",She loves sun-dried bath towels.,She felt healthier and closer to nature.,"She could bathe in the sunshine, too.",It gave her a break from her housework.,B

"In many sports, physical contact  is part of the game. But when athletes hit their heads, the hit can cause concussions . Concussions have long been a concern for professional athletes, but they've become more common among young players too. Between 2001 and 2009, the number of kids under 19 visiting doctors for concussions each year increased by 62 percent. Engineers are developing new helmets , and new rules are limiting physical contact in some sports. But are these efforts enough to protect kids' brains? Concussions can happen during many types of activities. But sports like football and soccer are especially risky. When you run or jump, your body is moving at an increased speed. A sudden hit causes you to move faster in a different direction. ""It's like when you're in a bus and it makes a sudden stop,"" says Dr. Kevin Crutchfield, an expert at a sports concussion center in Baltimore, Maryland. ""You hit the inside of the bus."" This hit damages the brain. It affects the way the brain functions. So some sports require athletes to wear helmets. Helmets help reduce the force of a hit. The hard outer shell spreads the force of larger area. Inside a helmet, a plastic or air-filled lining also helps soften the blow. Steve Rowson is an engineer at Virginia Tech. In his lab, he tests how helmets hold up against different types of hits. No helmet can prevent concussions completely, says Rowson. But he's found that when wearing a newer football helmet, the player's head doesn't gain speed as much after a hit. That lowers the risk of concussions. Many youth sports teams have set limits on physical contact to reduce the risk of concussions. In soccer, most concussions happen as a result of headers--shots or passes made with the head. That's why many people think kids shouldn't head the ball until high school. These efforts should help, says Crutchfield. But the best way to prevent long-term brain injuries, he says, is to stop playing immediately if you suffer concussion. ""Protect yourself today so you can play again tomorrow."" Concussions among young players   _  .",are rare before 2001,seem extremely worrying,cause kids to lose interest in sports,are mostly caused by wearing no helmets,B

The hard outer shell spreads the force of larger area. Inside a helmet, a plastic or air-filled lining also helps soften the blow. Steve Rowson is an engineer at Virginia Tech. In his lab, he tests how helmets hold up against different types of hits. No helmet can prevent concussions completely, says Rowson. But he's found that when wearing a newer football helmet, the player's head doesn't gain speed as much after a hit. That lowers the risk of concussions. Many youth sports teams have set limits on physical contact to reduce the risk of concussions. In soccer, most concussions happen as a result of headers--shots or passes made with the head. That's why many people think kids shouldn't head the ball until high school. These efforts should help, says Crutchfield. But the best way to prevent long-term brain injuries, he says, is to stop playing immediately if you suffer concussion. ""Protect yourself today so you can play again tomorrow."" Dr. Crutchfield suggests that after receiving a concussion, young players should  _  .",never head the ball,avoid dangerous sports,play other kinds of sports,stop playing the sport for a while,D
"On October 19, 1959, the first Special English program was broadcast on the Voice of America. It was an experiment. The goal was to communicate by radio in clear and simple English with people whose native language is not English. Experts said the goal was admirable, but the method would not work. They were proved wrong. The Special English programs quickly became some of the most popular on VOA. And they still are. Forty years later, Special English continues to communicate with people who are not fluent in English. But during the years its role has expanded. It also helps people learn American English. And it provides listeners, even those who are native English speakers, with information they cannot find elsewhere. Today, Special English broadcasts around the world seven days a week, five times a day. Each half-hour broadcast begins with ten minutes of the latest news followed by 20 minutes of feature programming. There is a different short feature every weekday about science, development, agriculture and environment, and on the weekend, about news events and American idioms. Three elements make Special English unique. It has a limited vocabulary of 1500 words. Most are simple words that describe objects, actions or emotions. Some are more difficult. They are used for reporting world events and describing discoveries in medicine and science. Special English is written in short, simple sentences that contain only one idea. No idioms are used. And Special English is spoken at a slower pace, about two-thirds the speed of Standard English. This helps people learning English hear each word clearly. It also helps people who are English speakers understand complex subjects. Through the years, Special English has become a very popular tool for teaching English, even though it was not designed as teaching program. It succeeds in helping people learn English in a non-traditional way. Individuals record the programs and play them over and over to practice their listening skills. In countries around the world, English teachers assign Special English to their students. They praise it for improving their students' ability to understand American English and for the content of the programs.

"2009 is the year of what? Yes, it's the year of the Ox. But do you know that 2009 is also the year of the telescope? This year the world celebrates the 400thanniversary of Galileo's observations of the universe through an astronomical telescope  . In 1609, the Italian scientist first pointed a ""Dutch perspective glass"" at the night sky and made discoveries that changed mankind's conceptions of the universe.  In honor of Galileo's discoveries, the United Nations and the International Astronomical Union have declared 2009 to be the International Year of Astronomy (IYA 2009). IYA 2009 is a yearlong celebration of astronomy. Its goal is to spread knowledge of astronomy's contributions to society and culture and to inspire more interest in astronomy and science, especially among young people. The theme of the celebration is ""The Universe, Yours to Discover."" One interesting aim of the IYA is to encourage more diversity   in the field of astronomy and physics. IYA organizers hope that the yearlong celebration of astronomy will inspire more females and underrepresented minorities to pursue   careers in science. An event that will help further that goal is 100 Hours of Astronomy (100 HA) that will fall on April. This event aims to have as many people as possible look through a telescope. From April 2ndto 5th, millions of people worldwide will peer through telescopes to catch their first glimpse   of the universe, just as Galileo's did 400 years ago. Sidewalk astronomy events will give city-dwellers   an excellent opportunity to see the moon, the planet Saturn, and other objects in position for early evening observations.

"Father's Day may be over in the United States, but animal dads are still hard at work. From penguins to catfish  , some animal fathers play a big part in raising their babies.     ""Seahorses are possibly the best example of fathers caring for their young in the animal world,"" said Heather Masonjones, a biologist at the University of Tampa in Florida. Human mothers carry their babies in their bodies for nine months. But seahorses are different. A female seahorse lays eggs and then puts them in a pouch on a male seahorse's belly  , where the eggs stay until they hatch.      Male seahorses aren't the only animal dads caring for eggs. The male hardhead catfish carries up to 48 marble- size eggs in his mouth for 60 days! He doesn't eat for the entire time. ""You'd think it would be hard for them to give up a meal,"" said Ed Matheson, a fish expert at the Florida Marine Research Institute.      Emperor penguins sit on eggs to hatch them during Antarctica's freezing winter. The males have to gather closely together for warmth and can lose half of their weight in the two months that it takes the baby penguins to hatch.      Even mammal   dads play a role in raising their young. The male South American marmoset   takes care of the baby in place of the mother a few weeks after she gives birth.      So next Father's Day, remember the millions of dads hard at work in the animal kingdom! How many kinds of animal dads does this text mention?",One.,Two.,Three.,Four.,D

"Liyuan style Peng Liyuan,wife of President Xi Jinping, has drawn extensive attention from people both at home and abroad for her charisma and grace. Accompanying her husband on his first overseas trip after becoming president, Peng Liyuan exhibited graceful demeanor, a pleasant personality and well-chosen dress, prompting people to coin the term ""Liyuan style"". Peng Liyuan, as one of China's best-known singers, was popular among Chinese people long before her husband became the president. Loved by her fans, she has been in touch with the people for years. ""Liyuan style"" is not only representative of a fashion idol, but also overpass cultural and diplomatic barriers. The beautiful handbags Peng has carried, and the plain but elegant and delicate dresses she has worn have become popular. Her choice of clothing, made-in-China instead of luxurious foreign brands, shows her belief in domestic dress designs. But ""Liyuan style"" is not only about clothing and a woman's _ . It is also about diplomacy and promoting, China's soft power. In Moscow, Peng visited a boarding school for orphans and children estranged from their parents, encouraging them to strive for a better life, which brought out the maternal side of her character. In Tanzania, she donated sewing machines and school bags to women and children. And as a World Health Organization ambassador in the fight against AIDS, Peng is devoted to many public causes, including those relating to charity and healthcare. Some observers have already started saying that Peng's activities have become part of public diplomacy in China. Also, ""Liyuan style"" has boosted the confidence of the Chinese people. Modern but not flashy, elegant but not arrogant, Peng has all the virtues of a Chinese woman and carries them to the international stage. Since the 18th Party Congress and the annual sessions of the NPC and CPPCC, the country's new leadership has vowed to adopt a down-to-earth work style to connect with the people. Peng's plain but elegant style shows that thriftiness and an earthy style need not be drab and boring. So it can be said that Peng's first appearance on the international stage has kicked off well. What's the meaning of the underline word ""paraphernalia""?",Things she carried with,Her self-charm,Her diplomatic measures,Her support to her husband,A

"Liyuan style Peng Liyuan,wife of President Xi Jinping, has drawn extensive attention from people both at home and abroad for her charisma and grace. Accompanying her husband on his first overseas trip after becoming president, Peng Liyuan exhibited graceful demeanor, a pleasant personality and well-chosen dress, prompting people to coin the term ""Liyuan style"".

The beautiful handbags Peng has carried, and the plain but elegant and delicate dresses she has worn have become popular. Her choice of clothing, made-in-China instead of luxurious foreign brands, shows her belief in domestic dress designs. But ""Liyuan style"" is not only about clothing and a woman's _ . It is also about diplomacy and promoting, China's soft power.

In Tanzania, she donated sewing machines and school bags to women and children. And as a World Health Organization ambassador in the fight against AIDS, Peng is devoted to many public causes, including those relating to charity and healthcare.

Peng's plain but elegant style shows that thriftiness and an earthy style need not be drab and boring. So it can be said that Peng's first appearance on the international stage has kicked off well. Which of the following statements is TRUE?","Peng firstly appears in the pubic as the ""First Lady"" in Moscow.","""Liyuan style"" is only a fashion idol.","Peng Liyuan, as the wife of President Xi, admires lots of Luxurious brands.",Pend Liyuan is willing to fight against AIDS and become an ambassador of WHO.,D
"Chokwe Selassie, aged 13, is working hard to help drivers avoid potholes . The eighth-grader was inspired to kick off his creation on a recent morning, when his mother was driving him to school. Their car was damaged as it went over a huge pothole in the middle of the street in their hometown of Jackson, Mississippi. He decided to do something about the pothole problem in his city. Chokwe developed the app with his friends Rodriguez Ratliff and Emmanuel Brooks. When the app detects a pothole, it is highlighted in red. And if you get close to the pothole, your phone will warn you with a beep. Drivers can also use the app to report any potholes and look for other routes they can take to avoid roads that have them. The app relies on current available information about the streets of Jackson, already stored in a database of the city's 311 call system. Through the call system, citizens dial 3-1-1 to report non-emergency problems which include potholes. Chokwe and his friends determined that focusing on the 10 busiest streets in Jackson would give them a large enough sample size to test the prototype. While developing the app, the boys took part in a Minority Male Makers Program sponsored by Verizon and held at Jackson State University. They learned 3D printing and design, and how to create apps. Through the program Chokwe and his friends received encouragement and guidance. Although the app isn't yet available for sale, Chokwe is already looking for ways to improve the app. He hopes to add more to it until it spreads all over the country. What is the app used to do?",Warn drivers about potholes.,Help drivers obey traffic rules.,Stop drivers using mobile phones.,Tell drivers to avoid red lights.,A

"Many of us enjoy doing it: you turn on the camera on your mobile phone and hold it at a high angle--- making your eyes look bigger and your cheekbones more defined. You turn to your best side and click. There it is - your selfie. Over the past year, ""selfie"" has become a well-known term across the globe. This August the Oxford dictionary added the word to their online dictionary and define it as: ""A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website.""

"""I say, I'm pleased to see you,"" said the little man standing by the letter-box. ""Oh, hello,"" I said, remembering he was a new neighbor. ""Simpson, isn't it?"" ""Yes, that's right."" He seemed quite pleased by my ready recognition. ""I wonder if you could lend me some money,"" he continued. ""My wife gave me a letter to post, and I've just noticed it isn't stamped."" ""yes, they never are,"" I said, sympathetically . ""It must go tonight--it really must! I'd get stamps out of the machine,"" explained Simpson,"" Only I find I have no small change about me."" ""I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I haven't either,"" I said. ""Oh, dear, dear,"" he said. ""Yes, well,"" I said, intending to move off. But he looked so unhappy standing there with the blue unstamped envelope that I really hadn't the heart to desert him. So I took him to my house and found some pennies and gave them to him, who, in the most business like way, made a note of the loan in his pocket-book, and left. But soon he turned up again. ""I'm sorry I am a stranger round here and --well, I'm rather lost..."" It took me several minutes to explain to him where the post office was. In the end I felt as lost as Simpson and had to accompany him to the post office, but, only to find the automatic stamp-machine was empty! ""Oh!"" Simpson was so desperate that he dropped the letter on the ground and when he picked it up there was a large black spot on its face. ""Dear me,"" he said, ""My wife told me to post it tonight. I'd better post it, if you know what I mean."" I did know. Or, at least, I knew Mrs Simpson. Then I got a good idea, ""Post the letter unstamped--let the other man pay double postage on it in the morning. "" And he had to agree. Finishing off our job, I took him home. ""I'm so grateful to you, really,"" he said when we reached his home. ""That letter--it's only an invitation to dinner to Mr... Dear me!"" ""Why, what's the matter?"" ""Nothing. Just something I've remembered."" ""What?"" But he didn't tell me. He just opened his eyes and his mouth at me like a wounded gold- fish, murmured a ""Good-night"", and went inside. All the way home I was wondering what it was that he had remembered. But I stopped wondering the next morning, when I had to pay the postman double postage for a blue envelope with a large black spot on its face. Simpson was very happy when the writer greeted him because    _   .",they were good friends,he had a very important letter to post,he saw somebody he could turn to at last,he didn't expect the writer to recognize him instantly,D
"""I say, I'm pleased to see you,"" said the little man standing by the letter-box. ""Oh, hello,"" I said, remembering he was a new neighbor. ""Simpson, isn't it?"" ""Yes, that's right."" He seemed quite pleased by my ready recognition. ""I wonder if you could lend me some money,"" he continued. ""My wife gave me a letter to post, and I've just noticed it isn't stamped."" ""yes, they never are,"" I said, sympathetically . ""It must go tonight--it really must! I'd get stamps out of the machine,"" explained Simpson,"" Only I find I have no small change about me."" ""I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I haven't either,"" I said. ""Oh, dear, dear,"" he said. ""Yes, well,"" I said, intending to move off. But he looked so unhappy standing there with the blue unstamped envelope that I really hadn't the heart to desert him. So I took him to my house and found some pennies and gave them to him, who, in the most business like way, made a note of the loan in his pocket-book, and left. But soon he turned up again. ""I'm sorry I am a stranger round here and --well, I'm rather lost..."" It took me several minutes to explain to him where the post office was. In the end I felt as lost as Simpson and had to accompany him to the post office, but, only to find the automatic stamp-machine was empty! ""Oh!"" Simpson was so desperate that he dropped the letter on the ground and when he picked it up there was a large black spot on its face. ""Dear me,"" he said, ""My wife told me to post it tonight. I'd better post it, if you know what I mean."" I did know. Or, at least, I knew Mrs Simpson. Then I got a good idea, ""Post the letter unstamped--let the other man pay double postage on it in the morning. "" And he had to agree. Finishing off our job, I took him home.

"A super drug that could remove Alzheimer's  ,heart disease and diabetes   and help people live to 100 is being developed by scientists. Their research is based on the identification of three genes that help prolong lives and prevent diseases which occur in old age. Medically controlling the proteins made by the "" longevity genes"" will allow millions to live longer, predicts Dr Nir Barzilai. Those whose DNA strongly features the three genes are 80 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's. The genes also fight against the deadly impact of smoking, poor diet, obesity and lack of exercise. Already, several laboratories are working on a pill to imitate the benefits of the genes and Dr Barzilai thinks it could be tested within three years. The pill could remove some diseases that damage old age. "" The advantage of finding a gene that involves longevity is that we can develop a drug that will imitate exactly what this gene is doing,"" he said. Of the three longevity genes, two genes increase the production of so-called good cholesterol , which reduces the risk of heart disease. The third prevents diabetes. They were discovered by Dr Barzilai's team while studying the DNA of 500 Ashkenazi Jews with an average age of 100. The chances of living that long are one in 10,000 but the group, which shared relatively few common ancestors, was 20 times more likely to hit the entury. Dr Barzilai said: "" 30 percent of them were obese or overweight and 30 percent smoked two acks of cigarettes a day for more than 40 years, however they can live to 100."" But Andrew Ketteringham of the Alzheimer's Society said: ""Alzheimer's disease, a most common disease, is likely to be caused by a combination of genetic disosition , lifestyles and life events.

"Computers have been used in teaching for more than twenty years. But a new book says that only now are they changing education. And it predicts that a lot more is about to happen. The book is called ""Disrupting Class: How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns."" ""Disruptive Innovation"" is a theory developed by lead author Clayton Christensen, a professor at the prefix = st1 /HarvardBusinessSchool. He says organizations almost always use new, creative technology only to continue what they already do. New technology should change organizations, he says, and disrupt them in a good way. They should use the technology to do things differently--for example, to serve more needs. The book says the needed disruptive force in education is computer-based learning. Michael Horn, another author of ""Disrupting Class"", told us about a Bostonpublic that he visited. Every student at Lilla G. Frederick Middle School inDorchester,Massachusetts, has a laptop computer. One class was learning about storms. Michael Horn says the laptops made it possible to truly individualize the lessons, to divide materials by ability level and learning style. At the end of the class, the students all took part in a discussion led by the teacher. Computer-based learning offers a way for students to take advanced courses not offered at their school, or to retake classes they failed. It also serves those who cannot physically attend school, and students who receive home schooling. Computer-based learning includes online courses. Enrollments in online courses have grown sharply. In 2007, the United Stateshad about one million enrollments, not including college courses. Students could be enrolled in more than one course, through schools or education companies. High school students make up about seventy percent of the enrollment. Still, nationally, only about one percent of all high school courses last year were taught online. But the authors of ""Disrupting Class""predict it will be ten percent in about six years. And their research suggests that the number will be about fifty percent by 2019. And Michael Horn says the future of online learning could be even greater in developing countries. Which of the following is TRUE about the book ""Disrupting Class""?",It was written by more than one author.,It thinks the computer affects students' studies.,It introduces a new scientific technology to readers.,It has been a best-seller since it was published.,A

"Good Housekeeping has discovered that even if a child wear a helmet when she bikes, or skates, it may not protect her from a serious head injury. Every year, 390,000 children under age 15 go to hospital emergency rooms with bike-related injuries. Of that number, about one third children suffer head injuries and an estimated 200 die. By wearing a helmet, a child can reduce her risk of injury by as much as 85 percent. But remember ---- a bicycle helmet must fit properly to be safe. Here are five steps to making sure your child's helmet fits properly. 1) If you haven't bought your child's helmet already, you might want to consider one with a rear stabilizer . A rear stabilizer holds the back of the head gently and helps the helmet stay correctly positioned. 2) The helmet should fit closely and shouldn't slide from side to side or front to back. If your child can put two fingers on both temples inside the helmet, it's too big. Try a smaller size. But if the next size down is too small, use the fit pads . Fit pads come in different sizes and attach to the helmet with Velcro. 3) Tell your child to open her mouth widely and ask if she can feel the helmet push down onto the top of her head. If she can't, you need to readjust her helmet. 4) To prevent strap slippage, wind a rubber band around the strap where it meets the fastener. 5) Recheck the fit regularly. You should replace the bicycle helmet: If she has been in an accident with it. If the buckle  breaks or if a piece breaks off. If it doesn't have a U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, American Society for Testing and Materials, or Snell Memorial Foundation sticker. If it doesn't fit correctly. Even if the helmet fit perfectly two years ago, it might be too small now. Who is this passage mainly written for?",Children.,Teachers.,Parents.,helmet producers.,C

If a girl finds a helmet a little bit big for her head, what should she do?",She must buy a smaller size.,She can use some fit pads.,She can put fingers on both temples inside the helmet.,She must make helmet slide from side to side.,B
"Good Housekeeping has discovered that even if a child wear a helmet when she bikes, or skates, it may not protect her from a serious head injury. Every year, 390,000 children under age 15 go to hospital emergency rooms with bike-related injuries. Of that number, about one third children suffer head injuries and an estimated 200 die. By wearing a helmet, a child can reduce her risk of injury by as much as 85 percent. But remember ---- a bicycle helmet must fit properly to be safe. Here are five steps to making sure your child's helmet fits properly. 1) If you haven't bought your child's helmet already, you might want to consider one with a rear stabilizer . A rear stabilizer holds the back of the head gently and helps the helmet stay correctly positioned. 2) The helmet should fit closely and shouldn't slide from side to side or front to back. If your child can put two fingers on both temples inside the helmet, it's too big. Try a smaller size. But if the next size down is too small, use the fit pads . Fit pads come in different sizes and attach to the helmet with Velcro. 3) Tell your child to open her mouth widely and ask if she can feel the helmet push down onto the top of her head. If she can't, you need to readjust her helmet. 4) To prevent strap slippage, wind a rubber band around the strap where it meets the fastener. 5) Recheck the fit regularly. You should replace the bicycle helmet: If she has been in an accident with it. If the buckle  breaks or if a piece breaks off. If it doesn't have a U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, American Society for Testing and Materials, or Snell Memorial Foundation sticker. If it doesn't fit correctly. Even if the helmet fit perfectly two years ago, it might be too small now. Phil White, a father, found the buckle of his girl's helmet broken, he can  _",buy a new bicycle helmet for her,mend the bicycle helmet himself,continue to use the bicycle helmet,throw away the broken buckle,A
"Some say everyday miracles   are predestined  ----the right time for the appointed meeting. And it can happen anywhere.  In 2001, 11-year-old Kevin Stephan was a bat boy for his younger brother's Little League team in Lancaster, New York. It was an early evening in late July. Kevin was standing on the grass away from the plate, where another youngster was warming up for the next game. Swinging his bat back and forth, giving it all the power an elementary school kid could give. The boy brought the bat back hard and hit Kevin in the chest. His heart stopped.  When Kevin fell to the ground, the mother of one of the players rushed out of the stands to his aid. Penny Brown hadn't planned to be there that day, but at the last minute, her shift   at the hospital had been changed to see her son's performance. She was given the night off. Penny bent over the senseless boy, his face already starting to turn blue, and giving CPR, breathing into his mouth and giving chest compressions. And he  _ in the end. After his recovery, he became a volunteer junior firefighter, learning some of the emergency first-aid techniques that had saved his life. He studied hard in school and was saving money for college by working as a dishwasher in a local restaurant in his spare time.  Kevin, now 18, was working in the kitchen when he heard people screaming, customers in confusion, employees rushing toward a table. He hurried into the main room and saw a woman there, her face turning blue, her hands at her throat. She was choking.  Quickly Kevin stepped behind her, wrapped his arms around her and clasped his hands. Then, using skills he'd first learned in Scouts. The food that was trapped in the woman's throat was freed. The color1 began to return to her face.  ""The food was stuck. I couldn't breathe,"" she said. She thought she was dying. ""I was very frightened.""  Who was the woman?  Penny Brown. The author wrote the passage to show us that   _  .",miracles are predestined and they can happen anywhere,whoever helps you in trouble will get a reward one day,God will help those who give others a helping hand,miracles won't come without any difficulty sometimes,A

"Reduce, reuse, and recycle. This familiar environmentalist slogan tells us how to reduce the amount of rubbish that ends up in landfills and waterways. The concept is being used to deal with one possibly dangerous form of waste -- electronic junk  , such as old computers, cell phones, and televisions. But this process for managing e-waste may be used in an way more often than not used, a recent report suggests. ""A lot of these materials are being sent to developing nations under the excuse of reuse -- to bridge the digital divide,"" said Richard Gutierrez, a policy researcher. One of the problems is that no one proves whether these old machines work before they hit the seaways. Because of this, the report says, e-waste is a growing problem in Lagos, Nigeria, and elsewhere in the developing world. Much of the waste ends up being thrown away along rivers and roads. Often it's picked apart by poor people, who may face dangerous exposure to poisonous chemicals in the equipment. Businessmen also pay workers a little money to get back materials such as gold and copper. This low-tech recovery process could expose workers and the local environment to many dangerous materials used to build electronics. According to Gutierrez, this shadow economy exists because the excuse of recycling and reusing electronics gives businessmen ""a green passport"" to ship waste around the globe. ""Developing nations must take upon some of the responsibility themselves,"" Gutierrez said. But, he added, ""A greater portion of this responsibility should fall on the exporting state."" China, for example, has become a dumping place for large amounts of e-waste. The nation is beginning to take action to stop the flow of dangerous materials across its borders. The Chinese government, after many years of denial is finally beginning to take the lead. The passage mainly tells us that    _   .",developing countries are facing serious environmental problems,e-waste is sent to developing countries under the excuse of reuse,developing countries are making full use of e-waste,e-waste is a growing problem in developed countries,B

"I saw a friend one day that I hadn't seen for quite a while. I greeted him with a hug and a big smile. He kissed me on the cheek in a very gentle way. Somehow this friendly kiss really made my day . I thought about his gentle kiss and appreciated the love. It's just a nice gift. Yesterday, I was on the telephone with my brother, and we spoke about our dad. He told me that one day, my dad was real sad. My brother had kissed his small child in front of my dad. Then with a tear in his eye, my daddy said to him, ""I wished I had more often kissed you all."" My brother told him that it wasn't too late, and that he could start that day. Now my dad greets each of us with a kiss and we know what he's trying to say.  One day, sitting with my 82-year-old dad, I noticed that he seemed to be a little bit in upset. The words he shared with me indicated that he was in a spiritual trouble, so I got up, kissed him on the cheek and hugged him from behind. I said Dad, 'you are good.' And he agreed that he was blessed (  ). He has a wonderful family given by God. As I looked into his eyes, I noticed that they began to be filled with tears of love and joy. That evening I grabbed my mom one day when my mom was busy in her usual way, I stopped her for a while, kissed her on the cheek and said ""Mom thank you for everything, "" and she said ""Oh, it's okay"". She seemed to pull me back towards her as I pulled away. Thank you for that show of love is what she seemed to say.  They are some people that I wish I would have kissed more, like my grandma in heaven that I can not hug anymore.

"Some American parents might think their children need better education to compete with China and other countries' children. But how much do the parents themselves need to change? A new book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother written by Amy Chua has caused a debate about cultural differences in parenting. Ms. Chua is a professor at the Yale Law School in New Haven, Connecticut, and a mother of two daughters. She was raised in America by immigrant Chinese parents. In her book, Ms. Chua wrote about how she demanded excellence from her daughters. For example, she threatened to burn her daughter's dolls unless she played a piece of music perfectly. She would scold her daughters if they failed to meet her expectations. Ms. Chua had a clear list of what her daughters, Sophia and Louisa, were not permitted to do: ""Attend a sleepover, have a play date, watch TV or play computer games, be in a school play, get any grade less than an A."" Many people criticize Amy Chua, saying her parenting methods were cruel and violent. She even admits that her husband, who is not Chinese, sometimes objected to her parenting style. But she says that is the way her parents raised her and her three sisters. Ms. Chua says she eased some of the pressure after her younger daughter _ and shouted ""I hate my life! I hate you!"" But she also says American parents often have low expectations of their children's abilities.

She says Amy Chua's parenting style is not limited to Chinese families. It represents a traditional way of parenting among immigrants seeking a better future for their children.

"BEIJING -- The launch of a new manned space mission brings China closer to the establishment of a permanent space station, international experts say. Chinese taikonauts, Jing Haipeng, 50, and Chen Dong, 37, were _ into space onboard Shenzhou-11 at 7:30 am Monday and will spend 30 days in the Chinese space laboratory Tiangong-2.The launch marks a key step toward China's plan to eventually operate a permanent space station. The successful launch of the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft is another step forward to put China among leading players in space technology, said Alexander Zheleznyakov, a Russian expert on history of space flights. China's experimental space lab will help provide solutions for spacecraft of different functions to approach and anchor, and for a long-term operation of life support system, said Zheleznyakov. Shenzhou-11 is scheduled to anchor on Wednesday with Tiangong-2, which is part of China's plan to build a permanent space station by 2022. China can now test technologies for cargo spacecraft anchoring, life support system operation and water recycling to ensure a long-term continuous operation of its space station in the future with less dependence on renewal from the Earth, he said. If all goes well, China will launch the unpiloted Tianzhou-1 cargo ship next spring to autonomously tie up with Tiangong-2. Tianzhou-1 will be capable of automatically transferring rocket fuels, a vital requirement for space station grouping and maintenance, according to a report by Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). ""That will further their anchoring abilities needed for the larger space station,"" Johnson Freese was quoted."" Tiangong-2 is supposed to be able to stay in orbit for two years or longer, so that's taking them (Chinese) really close to 2019 or so. I think this will be their last big technology test phase before going to their large space station,"" said Freese. Why did China launch Shenzhou-11 into space?",To improve its launching ability.,To show off its space progress.,To set up a permanent space station.,To replace the space lab Tiankong-2.,C

"It's the worst event in human being's nautical history , six times more deadly than the Titanic . When the German cruise ship Wilhelm Gustloff was hit by torpedoes fired from a Russian submarine in the final winter of World War II , more than 10,000 people - mostly women , children and old people fleeing the final Red Army push into Nazi Germany - were packed aboard . An ice storm had turned the decks into frozen sheets that sent hundreds of families sliding into the sea as the ship tilted and began to go down . Others desperately tried to put lifeboats down . Some who succeeded fought off those in the water who had the strength to try to claw their way aboard . Most people froze immediately . "" I'll never forget the screams , "" says Christa Ntitzmann , 87 , one of the 1,200 survivors . She recalls watching the ship , brightly lit , slipping into its dark grave-and into seeming nothingness , rarely mentioned for more than half a century . Now Germany's Nobel Prize-winning author Gtinter Grass has revived the memory of the 9,000 dead , including more than 4,000 children-with his latest novel Crab Walk , published last month . The book ,which will be out in English next year , doesn't dwell on the sinking : its heroine is a pregnant young woman who survives the catastrophe only to say later : "" Nobody wanted to hear about it , not here in the West ( of Germany ) and not at all in the East . "" The reason was obvious . As Grass put in a recent interview with the weekly Die Woche : "" Because the crimes we Germans are responsible for were and are so dominant , we didn't have the energy left to tell of our own sufferings . "" The long silence about the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was probably unavoidable - and necessary . By unreservedly owning up to their country's monstrous crimes in the Second World War , Germans have managed to win acceptance abroad , _ the neo-Nazis at home and make peace with their neighbors . Today's unified Germany is more prosperous and stable than at any time in its long , troubled history . For that , a half century of willful forgetting about painful memories like the German Titanic was perhaps a reasonable price to pay . But even the most politically correct Germans believe that they've now earned the right to discuss the full historical record . Not to equate German suffering with that of its victims , but simply to acknowledge a terrible tragedy . Why does the author say the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was the worst event in nautical history ?",It was attacked by Russian torpedoes .,Most of its passengers were frozen to death .,Its victims were mostly women and children .,It caused the largest number of casualties .,D
"It's the worst event in human being's nautical history , six times more deadly than the Titanic . When the German cruise ship Wilhelm Gustloff was hit by torpedoes fired from a Russian submarine in the final winter of World War II , more than 10,000 people - mostly women , children and old people fleeing the final Red Army push into Nazi Germany - were packed aboard . An ice storm had turned the decks into frozen sheets that sent hundreds of families sliding into the sea as the ship tilted and began to go down . Others desperately tried to put lifeboats down . Some who succeeded fought off those in the water who had the strength to try to claw their way aboard . Most people froze immediately . "" I'll never forget the screams , "" says Christa Ntitzmann , 87 , one of the 1,200 survivors . She recalls watching the ship , brightly lit , slipping into its dark grave-and into seeming nothingness , rarely mentioned for more than half a century .

"Looking back on China's road to outer space, people can easily find it has not been very smooth. In the past years, Chinese people have made hard and determined efforts to realize the dream their ancestors had for thousands of years. After China's first satellite into the Earth's orbit in 1970 came four flights of unmanned Shenzhou missions  from 1999 to 2002. The country carried out its first one-piloted space flight in October, 2003, making China the third country in the world to have independent human spaceflight ability after the Soviet Union and the United States. Then came another breakthrough on October 12, 2005, when Shenzhou 6, China's second human spaceflight, was launched, with a crew of two astronauts. What's more, the landmark spacewalk done by Zhai Zhigang, one of the three boarding Shenzhou 7, launched on Sept. 25, 2008, leads the country further in its space exploration. Meanwhile, China's moon exploration project, started in 2004, has also been progressing satisfactorily. Fifty years after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the world's first man-made satellite, China's first circumlunar satellite Chang'e 1 took off on Oct.24, 2007, which became another milestone  in China's space achievements after the above-mentioned manned flights. Chang'e 1 was expected to fulfill four scientific goals, one of which was to probe mineral elements on the moon, especially those not existent on Earth. It's said that the lunar regolith  is abundant in helium-3, a clean fuel that may support the Earth's energy demands for more than a century. Nearly 3 years later, Oct. 1, 2010 witnessed the blasting off of Chang'e 2, China's 2nd unmanned lunar probe, marking another step forward in moon exploration. This time the aim is to test the key techniques of Chang'e 3 and Chang'e 4, as a preparation for a soft lunar landing in the future. With great expectations, people all over the world are looking forward to China's greater space achievements.

"Today, as I was relaxing at the beach, I couldn't help but eavesdrop(,) on a conversation four high school kids were having on the beach blanket next to me. Their conversation was about making a positive difference in the world. And it went something like this... ""It's impossible to make a difference unless you're a huge company or someone with lots of money and power,"" one of them said. ""Yeah man,"" another replied. ""My mom keeps telling me to move mountains - to speak up and stand up for what I believe. But what I say and do doesn't even get noticed. I just keep answering to 'the man' and then I get slapped back  in place by him when I step out of line."" ""Repression..."" another snickered. I smiled because I knew exactly how they felt. When I was their age, I was certain I was being repressed and couldn't possibly make a difference in this world. And I actually almost got fired from school once because I openly expressed how repressed  I felt in the middle of the principals' office. I Have A Dream. Suddenly, one of the kids noticed me eavesdropping and smiling. He sat up, looked at me and said, ""What? Do you disagree?"" Then as he waited for a response, the other three kids turned around too. Rather than arguing with them, I took an old receipt out of my wallet , tore it into four pieces, and wrote a different word on each piece. Then I crumbled the pieces into little paper balls and handed a different piece to each one of them. ""Look at the word on the paper I just gave you and don't show it to anyone else."" The kids looked at the single word I had handed each of them and appeared confused. ""You have two choices,"" I told them. ""If your word inspired you to make a difference in this world, then hold onto it. If not, give it back to me so I can recycle the paper."" They all returned their words. I walked over quickly , sat down on the sand next to their beach blanket and laid out the four words that the students had returned to me so that the words combined to form the simple sentence,        ""I have a dream."" ""Dude, that's Martin Luther King Jr.,"" one of the kids said. ""How did you know that?"" I asked. ""Everyone knows Martin Luther King Jr."" the kid snarled. ""He has his own national holiday, and we all had to memorize his speech in school a few years ago."" ""Why do you think your teachers had you memorize his speech?"" I asked. ""I don't really care!"" the kid replied. His three friends shook their heads in agreement. ""What does this have to do with us and our situation?"" ""Your teachers asked you to memorize those words, just like thousands of teachers around the world have asked students to memorize those words, because they have inspired millions of repressed people to dream of a better world and take action to make their dreams come true. Do you see where I'm going with this?"" ""Man, I know exactly what you're trying to do and it's not going to work, alright?"" the fourth kid said, who hadn't spoken a word until now. ""We're not going to get all inspired and emotional about something some dude said thirty years ago. Our world is different now. And it's more screwed up than any us can even begin to imagine, and there's little you or I can do about it. We're too small, we're nobody."" Together I smiled again because I once believed and used to say similar things. Then after holding the smile for a few seconds I said, ""On their own, 'I' or 'have' or 'a' or 'dream' are just words. Not very compelling or inspiring. But when you put them together in a certain order, they create a phrase that has been powerful enough to move millions of people to take action - action that changed laws, perceptions, and lives. You don't need to be inspired or emotional to agree with this, do you?"" The four kids shrugged and struggled to appear totally indifferent, but I could tell they were listening intently. ""And what's true for words is also true for people,"" I continued. ""One person without help from anyone else can't do much to make a big difference in this crazy world - or to overcome all of the various forms of repression that exist today. But when people get together and unite to form something more powerful and meaningful then themselves, the possibilities are endless.

""One person without help from anyone else can't do much to make a big difference in this crazy world - or to overcome all of the various forms of repression that exist today. But when people get together and unite to form something more powerful and meaningful then themselves, the possibilities are endless.

"Today, as I was relaxing at the beach, I couldn't help but eavesdrop(,) on a conversation four high school kids were having on the beach blanket next to me. Their conversation was about making a positive difference in the world. And it went something like this... ""It's impossible to make a difference unless you're a huge company or someone with lots of money and power,"" one of them said. ""Yeah man,"" another replied. ""My mom keeps telling me to move mountains - to speak up and stand up for what I believe. But what I say and do doesn't even get noticed. I just keep answering to 'the man' and then I get slapped back  in place by him when I step out of line."" ""Repression..."" another snickered. I smiled because I knew exactly how they felt. When I was their age, I was certain I was being repressed and couldn't possibly make a difference in this world. And I actually almost got fired from school once because I openly expressed how repressed  I felt in the middle of the principals' office. I Have A Dream. Suddenly, one of the kids noticed me eavesdropping and smiling. He sat up, looked at me and said, ""What? Do you disagree?"" Then as he waited for a response, the other three kids turned around too. Rather than arguing with them, I took an old receipt out of my wallet , tore it into four pieces, and wrote a different word on each piece. Then I crumbled the pieces into little paper balls and handed a different piece to each one of them. ""Look at the word on the paper I just gave you and don't show it to anyone else."" The kids looked at the single word I had handed each of them and appeared confused. ""You have two choices,"" I told them. ""If your word inspired you to make a difference in this world, then hold onto it. If not, give it back to me so I can recycle the paper."" They all returned their words. I walked over quickly , sat down on the sand next to their beach blanket and laid out the four words that the students had returned to me so that the words combined to form the simple sentence,        ""I have a dream."" ""Dude, that's Martin Luther King Jr.,"" one of the kids said. ""How did you know that?"" I asked. ""Everyone knows Martin Luther King Jr."" the kid snarled. ""He has his own national holiday, and we all had to memorize his speech in school a few years ago."" ""Why do you think your teachers had you memorize his speech?"" I asked. ""I don't really care!"" the kid replied. His three friends shook their heads in agreement. ""What does this have to do with us and our situation?"" ""Your teachers asked you to memorize those words, just like thousands of teachers around the world have asked students to memorize those words, because they have inspired millions of repressed people to dream of a better world and take action to make their dreams come true. Do you see where I'm going with this?"" ""Man, I know exactly what you're trying to do and it's not going to work, alright?"" the fourth kid said, who hadn't spoken a word until now. ""We're not going to get all inspired and emotional about something some dude said thirty years ago. Our world is different now. And it's more screwed up than any us can even begin to imagine, and there's little you or I can do about it. We're too small, we're nobody."" Together I smiled again because I once believed and used to say similar things. Then after holding the smile for a few seconds I said, ""On their own, 'I' or 'have' or 'a' or 'dream' are just words. Not very compelling or inspiring. But when you put them together in a certain order, they create a phrase that has been powerful enough to move millions of people to take action - action that changed laws, perceptions, and lives.

"For many years there's been a debate about rewarding our children. Does it work? Is it effective? Some people think we should establish a standard with our kids and give them something for meeting this standard as a reward. Punishment is given out in much the same way, but it's used when certain standards of performance, behavior, etc. have not been met. Kids will often become more dutiful when threatened with punishment, and work harder when promised a valuable reward. The problem is what happens when you aren't around. To develop responsible, self-disciplined   kids, parents need to promote certain ideas. One of these ideas is that everyone pitches in   and helps in your family, even if someone is not crazy about helping. Another idea is that there can be enjoyment in doing any task if we choose to make it so. When a task is for a worthy cause (our family can enjoy the house more because I have helped clean it), and when parents are cheerful about their chores, this message can have a big impact. This is how we help our kids develop a sense of responsibility. When our children develop this responsibility, they'll be more disciplined, and they'll control their emotions better. When we give rewards to our kids, we reduce the sense of responsibility. We also create children who may temporarily perform to a certain standard, but who aren't likely to continue the performance without the carrot hanging in front of them. ""Rewards and punishment can change behavior for a while, but they cannot change the person who engages in the behavior, at least in the way we want,"" said Alfie Kohn, author of Punished by Rewards. ""Good values have to be grown from the inside out."" Parents can help give their children a sense of shared responsibility and discipline which can last a lifetime. The real rewards that your children receive will be their readiness for the complex and demanding world that waits for them-- a world that rewards those who have learned the secrets of discipline and responsibility. So keep those shiny rewarding to yourself, and  _ . According to the passage, when children are threatened with punishment,_.",they may lose interest in their work,they may appear to be well-behaved,they may change to another person,the results will be worse than usual,B

"A man walked into a small Irish pub and ordered three beers. Bartender was surprised, but he served that man three beers. One hour later the man ordered three beers again. The very next day that man ordered three beers again and drank quietly at a table. This repeated several times and shortly after the people of the town were whispering about the man, who was ordering three beers at once. A couple of weeks later, the bartender decided to clear this out and inquired: ""I do not want to pry, but could you explain, why do you order three beers all the time?""

"Earlier, we explained how to begin a search for schools by going to one of the American educational advising centers around the world.

"Allen: I've never been in big fan of the bears, especially the vacation show. On my last trip to Disneyland (1999) we passed it by, because we didn't want to spend the time on something we didn't really enjoy. If we'd known it would be closed by our next visit, I'm sure we would have watched it one more time. I was just making the point that it wasn't until Disney announced the closing that this feeling suddenly sprang  up for the Country Bear Show at Disneyland. But I think the idea of keeping some attractions open forever regardless of the number of visitors it gets is a mistake. We all have great memories of the Bears, but clearly very few kids today (or I should say families today) are making those same memories from this show. That may be a sad fact, but it's a fact. Isn't it right to use the Country Bear space to bring in a more popular attraction so that more kids today can make those magic memories of an attraction they like? Otherwise aren't we just telling kids today that they ""have to"" make great memories of the Bears, when it's obvious that the kids themselves are not enjoying the Bears like we did? Roger: I am very disappointed that they have decided to retire the Country Bear Playhouse. I remember going to the show as a child, and still enjoyed it as a teenager, and now young adult. It is true that there aren't a lot of shows left at DL and with this one closing even less. Being at DL does require a lot of walking, and it is nice to have a few attractions that are a place to sit and enjoy a good show. I understand that DL has to develop, but there has to be some history to the Disneyland that Walt Disney first designed. There should be some parts of DL that just never go away, and this is one of them. By the time I have children it looks like there won't be any attractions that I can say I went to as a child at the rate they are going. Now the Bears are leaving, What I want to say is: stop trying to compete with everyone! DL is the best, because of attractions like the Country Bears. If DL insists on destroying all of its magic to make way for the latest, well, then it might as well be just another theme park. What news might get people talking about the problem of the Country Bears?",The Country Bear Playhouse will be closed.,There will be a new attraction for our guests at Disneyland.,The number of visitors to the Country Bear Playhouse is falling.,The Bears will retire because of old age and can't give shows any more.,A

"On the way to California, my family stopped for lunch. As we walked toward the entrance to the restaurant, a man with a dirty face jumped up from a chair, opened the door for us and greeted us in a friendly way. Once inside, my daughters said in a low voice, ""Mom, he smells."" After we ordered our lunch, I explained, telling the kids to look beyond the dirt. Seeing this rudeness truly upset me, I wanted to set a good example to my children, but sometimes being a good example was difficult. When our meal arrived, I realized I had left the car-sick pills in the truck. With the windiest trip ahead, the kids needed them, so Iwent back to the car for them. Just then, the ""doorman"" was opening the door for me, I said a loud ""thank you"" to him as I exited. When I returned, we talked a bit. He said he was not allowed inside unless he bought food. I went back and told my family his situation. Then I asked our waitress to add one soup and sandwich. The kids looked puzzled, but when I said the order was for the ""doorman"", they smiled. When it was time to continue our trip, I noticed the ""doorman"" enjoying his meal. Upon seeing me, he stood up and thanked me heartily. He then lifted his hand for a handshake and I gratefully accepted. I suddenly noticed the tears in his eyes-tears of gratitude  . What happened next drew great astonishment: I gave the ""doorman"" a hug. Back in truck, I fell into deep thought. While we can't choose many things in life, we can choose when to show gratitude. I said thanks to a man who had simply helped open a door for me, and also said thanks for that opportunity to teach my children by example. What attitude did the children show to the doorman at first?",dislike,surprise,puzzle,interest,A

"""Particulate Matter 2.5(PM2.5 for short)""is now ,it seems, officially an enemy of the people.The harmful,tiny pieces of matter,up to 2.5 microns in diameter, are too small to be seen by the naked eye.So they can be easily breathed into the lungs of people and do harm to people's health.With the issue of pollution so heatedly discussed,some people are wondering what possible solutions might be on the way.  _ might very well be a renewed effort to kick-start the electric car industry.Some reports suggest that the use of bakery cars should be expanded from the present five cities to 20 more.    But so far no country in the world has succeeded in making the dream of emission.free driving a reality.Despite the lofty ideal,the electric car has so far been a disappointment, accounting for only a fraction of l%of global car sales.And the same is true in China.There is an existing target to put five million on the road by 2020 but the Chinese consumer is so far very much unconvinced.     BYD Auto Company in the southern city of Shenzhen is just one electric vehicle maker hoping that the time is now ripe for the government to step up its efforts.BYD is making electric cars but as yet not selling in great numbers.Electric cars are not cheap.It would still leave more than$40,000 to be paid before you could drive away in a BYD e6.And buyers have worries other than price.     ""I think that when you talk to a regular Joe about electric vehicles he is excited, but when you ask Mr. Joe to buy one,he's nervous,""said Isbrand Ho from BYD's Auto Export Trade Division.""We call that 'range anxiety'.How far will my vehicle go?""

"Many independent Chinese women like to earn their own bread, even if their husbands are already bringing home the bacon. But a recent survey suggests that such women find more joy from relationships, rather than successful careers. About 73 percent of the 7,000 women surveyed in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou said they would choose to work even if their husbands earned enough for the family. The survey also found that 77 percent define happiness as ""enjoying a relationship"". But striking a balance between career and family can bring challenges to the woman's career advancement. ""In my company, women usually have an equal or even a higher starting salary than men,"" said Li Hua, general manager of Beijing Chuangjiashe Book Circulation Company. ""However, as they begin to climb up the career ladder, women often meet problems along the way, while men can climb the ladder more easily."" Both physical and emotional differences can prevent some women from taking tough positions, Li said. But family life is often the main difficulty for Chinese career women. Despite these challenges, however, some experts believe it's reasonable for some women to want to be breadwinners. ""In this way, the roles of a family are decided by the parents' abilities rather than their gender ,"" said Gu Donghui, a sociology professor at Fudan University. Gu says women should have the freedom to decide if they want to stay at home or work to support the family. ""Everyone has a different interpretation of what it means to find self-worth"". Wang Haibin, an economic expert from Renmin University shares that view: ""Traditionally, we tend to regard the family as the cell unit of society. Some members have always been expected to make sacrifices for it. But, it really doesn't matter who earns more. Economic independence and personal choice is essential for both sexes in the family.""

"Chinese female film stars, like Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi, due to the charm of their films, have set a good image for Chinese women in the world. Compared with Chinese women, the image of Chinese men is not so good in the eyes of Western women, the Shanghai Evening Post reported. In March 2006, Zhang Jiehai, a doctorate  holder at the Sociology Institute of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, led a research team to investigate how Western women look at Chinese men. The survey shows that many Western women think Chinese men are mostly known for their care for the family. Chinese men, as the Western women say, are willing to spend money for women. As to their shortcomings, Western women think that Chinese men do not have good manners and that some Chinese men have the habit of spitting everywhere, keeping nails and hair long, picking their noses and ears in public places, and not cleaning their teeth thoroughly. These bad habits make many Western women think that Chinese men are unwilling to take care of their personal image. The survey was carried out in two ways, by questionnaires and interviews. All the respondents  agreed that Chinese men show much tender loving care for the family and that many Chinese men do know how to respect women. They open the door for women and carry their handbags for them. For some American women, the bad image of Chinese men in the world is largely because of Hollywood films. In many Hollywood films, Chinese men usually do not have a good image. But this has been changed by Hong Kong film star Chow Yun-Fat.

"One of the most important things in the world is friendship.  In order to have friends, youhave to be a friend. You have to be with them in both good and bad times. In return, they will be there for you. But how can you be a good friend? Listen. Listen when they are talking. Keep eye contact. Don't say anything unless they ask you a question. Sometimes you're not required to have anything to say; they just need someone to talk to about their feelings. Help them. If your friends are ever in need of something, be there to help them. You should try to put them first, but make sure you don't become their slave  . Try to take an extra pencil or pen with you to classes as they may forget to take one.  Have a few extra dollars in your pocket in case they forget something they need. Be there for them. Try to make something for your friends to help make them feel better in hard times.

But he was frequently away; overseas much of the time and it would not be fair to the animal. Still, he thought about it anyway. In a few years he would be getting too old for the hard fieldwork. ""I must get a dog then."" He said to himself.                Drives like this always put him into a sentimental mood. The dog was part of it. Robert Kincaid was alone as it's possible to be--an only child, parents both dead, distant  s who had lost track of him and he of them, no close friends.               He thought about Marian. She had left him nine years ago after five years of marriage. He was fifty-two now, that would make her just under forty. Marian had dreams of becoming a musician, a folksinger. She knew all of the Weavers' songs and sang them pretty well in the coffeehouse of Seattle. When he was home in the old days, he drove her to the shows and sat in the audience while she sang.               His long absences--two or three months sometimes--were hard on the marriage. He knew that. She was aware of what he did when they decided to get married, and both of them had a vague(not clear) sense that it could all be handled somehow. It couldn't when he came from photographing a story in Iceland and, she was gone. The note read, ""Robert, it didn't work out, I left you the Harmony guitar. Stay in touch.""               He didn't stay in touch, neither did she. He's signed the divorce papers when they arrived a year later and caught a plane for Australia the next day. She had asked for nothing except her freedom. We can draw a conclusion from the passage that_.",Marian knew what would happen well before she married Kincaid.,Kincaid thought his absence would be a problem when he married Marian.,It turned out that Marian could not stand Kincaid's absence and left him.,"After Marian left him, they still kept in touch with each other.",C
"Since the nineteen nineties, education has been required for all South Africans from age seven to fifteen. Last December, the government announced that seventy percent of students passed their final examination to finish high school. In 2008 the passage rate was about sixty-three percent. There have been increases each year since then. Professor Shireen Motala at the University of Johannesburg says access to basic education is no longer the problem in South Africa. She says most children stay in school until they are about sixteen. The problem now, she says, is that large numbers of them leave without completing high school. Students take an examination known as the matric in grade twelve, their final or ""matriculation"" year. Professor Motala notes that less than half the children who started school in 2000 sat for the matric last year. He said, ""Only around forty-five percent survived, which means that a large number of children are falling by the wayside. And the concern is that where do those learners actually go to."" Educational researchers also point to another problem. They say South African schools do not produce enough students with the skills for higher education in math and science. One of those researchers is Graeme Bloch. He says many schools are not well-equipped. ""Because of poverty and limited resources, many children do not see laboratories and ninety-two percent of the schools do not have libraries."" Also, education specialists say in many cases, teachers and school principals do not have the skills or training to do their jobs. In other cases, they are simply not doing their duty to provide an education. Professor Motala says a number of teachers were poorly trained during the system of apartheid, or racial separation in South Africa. Apartheid ended in 1994. Secondly, she says, teachers have been confused by the many educational reform efforts in the last fifteen years. And, finally, she thinks language differences in the classroom have not gotten as much attention as they should. Subjects such as math and science are taught in English starting at about age ten. But South Africa has eleven official languages and many more unofficial ones. South Africa's minister of basic education promises a number of improvements. Angie Motshega says teacher development efforts will focus on subject and content knowledge, and making sure the correct teachers are in the correct jobs. Which of the following statements is WRONG?",There is a high dropout rate of students under 16 in South Africa.,More students with the skills for higher education in math and science are needed.,Racial separation in South Africa once affected the training of many teachers.,South Africa has eleven official languages and many more unofficial ones.,A

"The year is 2094. It has been announced that a comet  is heading towards the earth. Most of it will miss our planet, but two pieces will probably hit the southern half of the earth. On 17 July, a piece of 4 kilometers wide comet enters the Earth's atmosphere with a massive explosion . About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the seabed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards form the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned . Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes ash set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive. Could it really happen? In fact, it has already happened more than once in the history of the earth. The dinosaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years. Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared.

"Doreen Sykora is now a junior at McGill University. She had a difficult time when she first began college. She said, ""I was always well prepared for my examinations. But when I go into class to take the exam, I would fall apart. I could just _ because of nervousness and fear."" Hitoshi Sakamoto, an anthropology  student at Temple University in Tokyo reports similar experiences. These two young students were experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is stressed  about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the severe tension and nervousness. Now there are special university courses to help students. In these courses, advisors and psychologists try to help students by teaching them to manage test anxiety. Such a course helps students learn to live with stress and not fail because of it. First students take a practice test to measure their worry level. If the tests show that their stress level is high, the students can take a short course to manage the fear. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. They get training to become calm in very tense situations. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work more easily. Learned information then comes out without difficulty on a test. Doreen Sykora saw immediate results after taking such a course. She now has enthusiasm about the relaxation methods. ""Mostly, what I do is imagine myself in a very calm place. Then I imagine myself picking up a pencil. I move slowly and carefully. I breathe easily and let all the tension out. With each breath, more worry leaves me. It really works too. My grades have improved greatly! I'm really doing well at McGill now. This relaxation method works not only on examinations, but it has improved the rest of my life as well."" For Hitoshi in Tokyo, the results were much the same. He is enjoying school a lot more and learning more. What is the similarity between Doreen Sykora and Hitoshi Sakamoto?",They are students from the same university.,They failed in all the examinations.,They both had experiences of test anxiety.,They both had the same poor studying habits.,C

"Surprisingly, no one knows how many children receive education in English hospitals, still less the content or quality of that education. Proper records are just not kept. We know that more than 850,000 children go through hospital each year, and that every child of school age has a legal right to continue to receive education while in hospital. We also know there is only one hospital teacher to every 1,000 children in hospital. Little wonder the latest survey concludes that the extent and type of hospital teaching available differ a great deal across the country. It is found that half the hospitals in England which admit children have no teacher. A further quarter have only a part-time teacher. The special children's hospitals in major cities do best; general hospitals in the country and holiday areas are worst off. From this survey, one can estimate that fewer than one in five children have some contact with a hospital teacher--and that contact may be as little as two hours a day. Most children interviewed were surprised to find a teacher in hospital at all. They had not been prepared for it by parents or their own school. If there was a teacher they were much more likely to read books and do math or number work; without a teacher they would only play games. Reasons for hospital teaching range from preventing a child falling behind and maintaining the habit of school to keeping a child occupied, and the latter is often all the teacher can do. The position and influence of many teachers was summed up when parents referred to them as ""the library lady"" or just ""the helper"". Children tend to rely on concerned school friends to keep in touch with school work. Several parents spoke of requests for work being ignored or refused by the school. Once back at school children rarely get extra teaching, and are told to catch up as best they can. Many short-stay child-patients catch up quickly. But schools do very little to ease the anxiety about falling behind expressed by many of the children interviewed. Which of the following statements is true?",Every child in hospital receives some teaching.,Not enough is known about hospital teaching.,Hospital teaching is of poor quality.,The special children's hospitals are worst off.,B

"Just when scientists think they have discovered and recorded every species of insect that crawls on the earth they find something new.Earlier this month, Peter Jager, the head of Frankfurt's Senckenberg Research Institute reported the discovery of a unique eyeless spider! The creature that has a leg span   of six centimeters and a body size of just twelve millimeters was found in a cave inside the tiny nation of Laos, in Southeast Asia. It was identified as a member of the Huntsman spider, a large family that consists of 1100 species.However, the other members of the family all have eyes.The spider is the first one that has no eyes.The scientists believe that the reason for the lack of eyes can be that these spiders spend their entire life inside caves.In the past they have seen other members of the Huntsman spiders living in caves with six or less eyes.They believe that the kind of spider has adapted to the fact that they do not really need the eyes to such an extreme measure that they have  _ them altogether. But they are not the only creature to have done that.Over the years, scientists have discovered completely blind cave fish, and even a freshwater crab, which happens to live in the same cave as this eyeless spider! Surrounded by Burma and China on the northwest, Vietnam on the east, Cambodia on the South and Thailand on the west, the landlocked nation of Laos has been a treasure trove  of an incredible number of new and exotic   species.In the last few years researchers have discovered the Saola -- never-before seen antelope-like creature, a small deer species called muntjacs, a tiny striped rabbit and a rock rat that was thought to have been extinct 11 million years ago.In addition to that it is also home to over one hundred species of large mammals ranging from tigers to macaques and over 165 species of amphibians and reptiles like the terrible King cobra and the noisy Tokay gecko, a permanent resident  inside most Laos households.

"Hummingbirds have got their name from the distinct ""hum"" sound made by their rapidlyflapping  wings. The size of the bird decides the number of flaps it can do. The average lifetime of a hummingbird is 3 or 4 years, but some of them have lived beyond 12 years also. They are unique in many ways. Besides the number of rapid flaps they can do per second, they can also fly backwards. Hummingbirds have an amazing sense of assessing the amount of sugar in thenectar  they eat. They feed on the nectar of flowers. Hummingbirds do not feed on flowers whose nectar contains less than 10% sugar. Talk about a sweet tooth! As they cannot sustain themselves on nectar alone because of its poor nutritional value, they also feed on insects and spiders, and hummingbird food mixture that one can make at home. Attracting hummingbirds to your garden will require a little planning. Plant butterfly bush, mimosa, coral bells, foxglove, morning glory, etc. These flowers attract the hummingbirds due to their highvisibility  and nectar production. Avoid usingpesticides , as it will not only kill the insects around the flowers, but hurt the hummingbirds as well. A common food for these birds is the sweettastingsugar syrup . Hummingbird food ingredients are just two: sugar and water. Take a large clean bowl, pour in it four cups of hot water, and dissolve one cup of table sugar in it.

"In the past, people who graduated from college felt proud of their academic achievements and confident that their degree would help them to find a good job.   However, in the past four years the job market has changed greatly. This year's college graduates are facing one of the worst job markets. For example, Ryan Stewart, a graduate of San Jose State University, got a degree in religious studies, but he has not gotten any job offers. He points out that many people already working are getting laid off and don't have jobs, so it's even harder for new college graduates to find jobs.   Four years ago, the future looked bright for his class of 2006. There were many high-tech(""dot com"") job opportunities, graduates received many job offers, and they were able to get jobs with high salaries and benefits such as health insurance and paid vacations. However, ""Times have changed. It's a new market,"" according to an officer of the university.   The officer says students who do find jobs started preparing two years ago. They worked during summer vacations, they have had several short-time jobs, and they majored in fields that are still paying well, such as accounting or nursing.   Even teaching is not a secure profession now. Ryan Stewart wanted to be a teacher. But instead he will probably go back to school in order to become a college teacher. He thinks college teaching could be a good career even in a bad economy.   In conclusion, these days a college degree does not automatically lead to a good job with a high salary. Some students can only hope that the value of their degree will increase in the future. What did a college degree mean to people in the past?",It was a proof of their professional skills.,It would guarantee their quick promotion .,It built up their confidence in the job market.,It would help them to start an academic career.,C

"Getting kids to share their toys is a never-ending battle, and forcing them to do so never seems to help. New research suggests that allowing children to make a choice to sacrifice their own toys in order to share with someone else makes them share more in the future. The new findings are published inPsychological Science. These experiments were conducted by psychological scientists, Nadia Chernyak and Tamar Kushnir of Cornell University. They found that sharing things with others when they are given a difficult choice leads children to think of themselves as people who like to share. It also makes them more likely to act in a pro-social  manner in the future. Previous research has explained why rewarding children for sharing can _ . Children come to think of themselves as people who don't like to share since they had to be rewarded for doing so. Because they don't view themselves as ""sharers"", they are less likely to share in the future. Chernyak and Kushnir were interested in finding out whether freely chosen sacrifice might have the opposite effect on kids' willingness to share. To test this, the researchers introduced five-year-old children to Doggie, a sad puppet. Some of the children were given a difficult choice: Share a precious sticker  with Doggie, or keep it for themselves. Other children were given an easy choice between sharing and putting the sticker away, while children in a third group were required by the researcher to share. Later on, all the children were introduced to Ellie, another sad puppet. They were given the option of how many stickers to share (up to three). The kids who earlier made the difficult choice to help Doggie shared more stickers with Ellie. The children who were initially faced with an easy choice or who were required to give their sticker to Doggie, on the other hand, shared fewer stickers with Ellie. Therefore, children did not benefit from simply giving something up, but rather from willingly choosing to give something up of value. ""You might imagine that making difficult, costly choices is demanding for young children or even that once children share, they don't feel the need to do so again,"" Chernyak says. ""But this wasn't the case: once children made a difficult decision to give up something for someone else, they were more generous, not less, later on.""

"You may have heard about the many benefits of yoga, but a recent New York Times story, has stirred up more than a little controversy in the yoga community. ""How Yoga Can _ Your Body,"" by science writer William J. Broad, quotes a long-time yoga teacher who ""...has come to believe that 'the vast majority of people' should give up yoga altogether. It's simply too likely to cause harm."" He goes on to describe a number of cases where people have been injured doing yoga, including himself. The research in the article isn't groundbreaking: doing any form of exercise you could potentially hurt yourself. If you look at the injury rates of other physical activities, the number of injuries sustained from yoga would pale in comparison. Practicing yoga is just like anything in life: You have to push yourself in order to grow. But you also have to know your limits and when you're breaking them. If you stick to your comfort zone, you'll never be able to increase your flexibility. If you push to the point where you're not only uncomfortable, but in real pain, you'll likely injure yourself. The reasons that yoga causes ""serious injury"", according to the Times story, range from students' physical weaknesses to inexperienced teachers pushing too hard to the growing number of inflexible ""urbanites who sit in chairs all day"" trying hard to twist themselves into difficult postures. Yoga is called a ""practice"" for a reason. You don't have to be perfect. You don't have to tackle every pose. It doesn't matter if you can touch the floor with your palms during your first forward bend or your thousandth, or if you never get there. We go to the mat to learn to better listen to what our bodies are telling us, and to better hear that quiet inner voice drowned out by the noise of our busy lives.

"We've been judging people based on the way they look for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks turned it into a science, ""physiognomy"". As early as 500 BC, the mathematician Pythagoras would look carefully at young men's faces to determine if they'd make a good student, not long after Aristotle wrote how large-headed people were mean. It was widely believed at the time that the animal a person resembled was a good judge of character. By the Middle Ages it was well and truly mainstream. Professionals coined the phrase ""stuck-up"" to refer from the belief that those with upturned noses had an air of superiority, ""high-brow"" to refer to the high foreheads of nobles and ""low-brow"" to the less educated foreheads of the lower classes. Back in 2016, we're still doing it. We view those who resemble Labradors   as warm, while those who resemble lions as more of a ruler. We think of those with ""resting moody face"" as more aggressive, those who are less attractive as sick and expect people who look familiar to share our values. Many of these judgments occur in as little as 50 milliseconds. To get to understand and find out why having a babyface is so great, first we need to know what happens when we recognize an actual baby. In fact, the features of babies and those universally considered ""cute"" are nothing more than a series of developmental accidents. Our eyes are already fully grown by the time we're born but our heads aren't. Similarly, our bodies do a lot more growing later on than our heads. Babies have more body fat than adults, chubby  cheeks, for example. The list goes on. And regardless of whether you're very maternal   or find babies really annoying, we're unconditionally to respond to their features by turning into gentle baby-talking fools. Most importantly, gazing into their innocent faces makes us less aggressive and more generous and helpful. So there you have it. Next time you find yourself staring affectionately into the eyes of a baby-faced friend, colleague or date, just remember, you may be the latest victim in a long-running systematic evolutionary trick.

"Any diet on which you eat fewer calories than you need to get through the day -- like an 800-calorie-per-day diet can be dangerous. Diets that don't allow any fat also can be bad for you. Everyone needs a certain amount of fat in their diet -- up to 30% of total calories -- so no one should eat a completely fat-free diet. Don't have diets that restrict  certain food groups, either. A diet that requires you to say no to bread or pasta or allows you to eat only fruit is unhealthy. You won't get the vitamins and minerals you need. And although you may lose weight, you'll probably gain it back as soon as you start eating normally again. Some people start dieting because they think all the problems in their lives are because of weight. Others have an area of their lives that they can't control, like an alcoholic parent, so they focus on something they can control -- their exercise and food intake. People who diet may get lots of praise from friends and family when they start losing pounds, which makes them feel good. But eventually a person reaches a weight level -- and doesn't lose as much weight as before because the body is trying to keep a healthy weight, so they aren't any happier. Some people may find it hard to control their eating, so they stick with  _ for a little while, but then eat tons of food. Feeling guilty about the binge, they use laxatives . Eating too little to maintain a healthy weight or eating only to throw up the calories are both eating disorders, which are harmful to a person's health.

"The latest research suggests that the key factor separating geniuses from the merely accomplished is not I.Q., a generally bad predictor of success. Instead, it's purposeful practice. Top performers spend more hours practising their craft. If you wanted to picture how a typical genius might develop, you'd take a girl who possessed a slightly above average language ability. It wouldn't have to be a big talent, just enough so that she might gain some sense of distinction. Then you would want her to meet, say, a novelist, who coincidentally shared some similar qualities. Maybe the writer was from the same town, had the same family background, or shared the same birthday.  This contact would give the girl a vision of her future self. It would give her some idea of a fascinating circle who might someday join. It would also help if one of her parents died when she was 12, giving her a strong sense of insecurity and fuelling a desperate need for success. Armed with this ambition, she would read novels and life stories of writers without end. This would give her a primary knowledge of her field.

"Negative self talk and negative energy can affect you in many ways and cause you additional stress. Because of this, developing more positive self talk is an important way to reduce stress in your life. You can help yourself maintain a positive frame of mind which will help with positive self talkby surrounding yourself with positive energy in your life. You can get that by adding some elements to your life. Listening to music that not only has a pleasant melody, but an uplifting message, can be great for developing positive self talk. Have you ever had a song ""stuck in your head"" for a few hours or days, the lyrics   repeating themselves in your mind? If those lyrics were positive and inspirational, that would be a good thing. It's a much better mental soundtrack to have than a running stream of complaints, criticisms of self-limiting thoughts, or even songs that had more depressing or sad lyrics. Books on strength, personal power, enlightenment, or self help can be good resources to help you change your outlook and the things you say to yourself. Rather than bringing habitual self-defeating thoughts, you can find yourself thinking of new can-do concepts when times get tough. One of the most important ways you can get and keep positive energy in your life is with the company you keep. Do your friends uplift you, or bring you down? Are they critical, or approving? Ideal friendships provide support when you're down, fun when you're up, wisdom when you're lost. Good friends can inspire you to reach greater heights, and see your strengths even when you don't always. Pay attention to how your friends make you feel, and if they're less than supportive, start putting your energy and time toward people who are better suited to be your friends.

"Moral science is taught as a subject in most schools but with little effect. Perhaps part of the problem lies in the fact that morality is not a science, strictly speaking. It is too much of a social phenomenon, and also has too much of the personal and subjective things mixed within. Besides, morality itself changes with generations. So it is impossible to be defined in a textbook. I remember sitting through forty minutes of moral lessons, which told stories about little children who never told lies and were rewarded for their goodness. It had little effect and left no impression on me, though. If moral science has to be taught as a subject in schools, it needs a participatory  approach. When you tell a child about morals, you also have to deal with social norms and cultural differences. You have to explain that morality can be subjective, and be able to co-exist in society. You will probably have to refer to the morals of the present time. The best way to tell a child how to live is to show him what is valued. If a child likes his friend, you have to make the child think about why. Once the child notices and recognizes goodness in others, he or she is likely to develop it as well. In fact, children learn most of their morals by watching people around them. They absorb behavior patterns from teachers and older students. They watch to see what is rewarded and who is punished. They learn on the sports field and through social work. Moral science lessons should simply consist of letting them live and interact, and watch you support correct values and reward good behavior. Which is NOT the reason that moral science is taught in schools but with little effect?",Morality doesn't strictly belong to a science,Morality is more like a social phenomenon.,Different generations have different moral ideas.,Morality can't be written down in textbooks.,D

It is too much of a social phenomenon, and also has too much of the personal and subjective things mixed within. Besides, morality itself changes with generations. So it is impossible to be defined in a textbook. I remember sitting through forty minutes of moral lessons, which told stories about little children who never told lies and were rewarded for their goodness. It had little effect and left no impression on me, though. If moral science has to be taught as a subject in schools, it needs a participatory  approach. When you tell a child about morals, you also have to deal with social norms and cultural differences. You have to explain that morality can be subjective, and be able to co-exist in society. You will probably have to refer to the morals of the present time. The best way to tell a child how to live is to show him what is valued. If a child likes his friend, you have to make the child think about why. Once the child notices and recognizes goodness in others, he or she is likely to develop it as well. In fact, children learn most of their morals by watching people around them. They absorb behavior patterns from teachers and older students. They watch to see what is rewarded and who is punished. They learn on the sports field and through social work. Moral science lessons should simply consist of letting them live and interact, and watch you support correct values and reward good behavior. The author describes his own experience of having moral lessons in order to   _  .",explain telling lies is not moral for little children.,advise people should be rewarded for their goodness.,prove moral lessons in schools have little effect.,show he has no opinions about moral science.,C

"Hilton Shanghai, the city's first international hotel, has been recognized as a top business hotel in Shanghai for its convenient location and outstanding facilities for more than 20 years.

Some of them have personal relationships with customers. ''It's a people-relation business,'' Knaust says. ''They really tell me about the stories in the last 15 years. It's something very nice to listen to. It's also a lasting memory for the guests.'' In fact, over the years, some of the guests have stayed in the hotel 200 or even 300 times. Knaust, who has been working in the hospitality industry for more than 30 years, started his career as a chef in Germany. During his early 30s, Knaust already moved to the top in the culinary   field as director of kitchen of Hyatt Regency Cologne in Germany. After holding several general manager positions in Mandarin Oriental hotels, Knaust joined Hilton International as the general manager to open the Conrad and Doubletree by Hilton at Haitang Bay, Sanya in 2010. When he was appointed as the general manager of Hilton Shanghai in November, he not only was heavily involved in recruitment, sales and marketing strategies but also he worked closely with the food and beverage team to develop the hotel's restaurant concepts and menus.

"Pete Richards was the loneliest man in town on the day that little Jean Grace opened the door of his shop. Pete's grandfather had owned the shop until his death. Then the shop became Pete's. The front window was full of beautiful old things: jewelry of a hundred years ago, gold and silver boxes, carved figures from China and Japan and other nations. On this winter afternoon, a child stood there, her face close to the window. With large and serious eyes, she studied each piece in the window. Then, looking pleased, she stepped back from the window and went into the shop. Pete himself stood behind the counter. His eyes were cold as he looked at the small girl. ""Please,"" she began, ""would you let me look at the pretty string of blue beads in the window?"" Pete took the string of blue beads from the window. The beads were beautiful against his hand as he held the necklace up for her to see. ""They are just right,"" said the child as though she were alone with the beads. ""Will you wrap them up in pretty paper for me, please? I've been looking for a really wonderful Christmas present for my sister."" ""How much money do you have?"" asked Pete. She put a handful of pennies on the counter. ""This is all I have,"" she explained simply. ""I've been saving the money for my sister's present."" Pete looked at her, his eyes thoughtful. Then he carefully closed his hand over the price mark on the necklace so that she could not see it. How could he tell her the price? The happy look in her big blue eyes struck him like the pain of an old wound. ""Just a minute,"" he said and went to the back of the shop. ""What's your name?"" he called out. He was very busy about something. ""Jean Grace,"" answered the child. When Pete returned to the front of the shop, he held a package in his hand. It was wrapped in pretty Christmas paper. ""There you are,"" he said. ""Don't lose it on the way home."" She smiled happily at him as she ran out of the door. Through the window he watched her go. He felt more alone than ever. Something about Jean Grace and her string of beads had made him feel once more the pain of his old grief. The child's hair was as yellow as the sunlight; her eyes were as blue as the sea. Once upon a time, Pete had loved a girl with hair of that same yellow and with eyes just as blue. And the necklace of blue stones had been meant for her. But one rainy night, a car had gone off the road and struck the girl. After she died, Pete felt that he had nothing left in the world except his grief. The blue eyes of Jean Grace brought him out of that world of self-pity and made him remember again all that he had lost. The pain of remembering was so great that Pete wanted to run away from the happy Christmas shoppers who came to look at his beautiful old things during the next ten days. When the last shopper had gone, late on Christmas Eve, the door opened and a young woman came in. Pete could not understand it, but he felt that he had seen her before. Her hair was sunlight yellow and her eyes were sea-blue. Without speaking, she put on the counter a package wrapped in pretty Christmas paper. When Pete opened the package, the string of blue beads lay again before him. ""Did this come from your shop?"" she asked. Pete looked at her with eyes no longer cold. ""Yes, it did,"" he said. ""Are the stones real?"" ""Yes. They aren't the best turquoise , but they are real."" ""Can you remember to whom you sold them?"" ""She was a small girl. Her name was Jean. She wanted them for her sister's Christmas present."" ""How much were they?"" ""I can't tell you that,"" he said. ""The seller never tells anyone else what a buyer pays."" ""But Jean has never had more than a few pennies. How could she pay for them?"" "" "" he said. For a moment there was no sound in the little shop. Then somewhere in the city, church bells began to ring. It was midnight and the beginning of another Christmas Day. ""But why did you do it?"" the girl asked. Pete put the package into her hands. ""There is no one else to whom I can give a Christmas present,"" he said. ""It is already Christmas morning. Will you let me take you to your home? I would like to wish you a Merry Christmas at your door."" And so, to the sound of many bells, Pete Richards and a girl whose name he had not yet learned walked out into the hope and happiness of a new Christmas Day.

Once upon a time, Pete had loved a girl with hair of that same yellow and with eyes just as blue. And the necklace of blue stones had been meant for her. But one rainy night, a car had gone off the road and struck the girl. After she died, Pete felt that he had nothing left in the world except his grief. The blue eyes of Jean Grace brought him out of that world of self-pity and made him remember again all that he had lost. The pain of remembering was so great that Pete wanted to run away from the happy Christmas shoppers who came to look at his beautiful old things during the next ten days. When the last shopper had gone, late on Christmas Eve, the door opened and a young woman came in. Pete could not understand it, but he felt that he had seen her before. Her hair was sunlight yellow and her eyes were sea-blue. Without speaking, she put on the counter a package wrapped in pretty Christmas paper. When Pete opened the package, the string of blue beads lay again before him. ""Did this come from your shop?"" she asked. Pete looked at her with eyes no longer cold. ""Yes, it did,"" he said. ""Are the stones real?"" ""Yes. They aren't the best turquoise , but they are real."" ""Can you remember to whom you sold them?"" ""She was a small girl. Her name was Jean. She wanted them for her sister's Christmas present."" ""How much were they?"" ""I can't tell you that,"" he said. ""The seller never tells anyone else what a buyer pays."" ""But Jean has never had more than a few pennies. How could she pay for them?"" "" "" he said. For a moment there was no sound in the little shop. Then somewhere in the city, church bells began to ring. It was midnight and the beginning of another Christmas Day. ""But why did you do it?"" the girl asked. Pete put the package into her hands. ""There is no one else to whom I can give a Christmas present,"" he said. ""It is already Christmas morning. Will you let me take you to your home? I would like to wish you a Merry Christmas at your door."" And so, to the sound of many bells, Pete Richards and a girl whose name he had not yet learned walked out into the hope and happiness of a new Christmas Day. The eyes of Jean Grace brought Pete out of his world of self-pity and he    _   .",tried to forget the memory of his sweetheart,began to look at the world optimistically,remembered his lost love,no longer felt the pain in him,C
"Pete Richards was the loneliest man in town on the day that little Jean Grace opened the door of his shop. Pete's grandfather had owned the shop until his death. Then the shop became Pete's. The front window was full of beautiful old things: jewelry of a hundred years ago, gold and silver boxes, carved figures from China and Japan and other nations. On this winter afternoon, a child stood there, her face close to the window. With large and serious eyes, she studied each piece in the window. Then, looking pleased, she stepped back from the window and went into the shop. Pete himself stood behind the counter. His eyes were cold as he looked at the small girl. ""Please,"" she began, ""would you let me look at the pretty string of blue beads in the window?"" Pete took the string of blue beads from the window. The beads were beautiful against his hand as he held the necklace up for her to see. ""They are just right,"" said the child as though she were alone with the beads. ""Will you wrap them up in pretty paper for me, please? I've been looking for a really wonderful Christmas present for my sister."" ""How much money do you have?"" asked Pete. She put a handful of pennies on the counter. ""This is all I have,"" she explained simply. ""I've been saving the money for my sister's present."" Pete looked at her, his eyes thoughtful. Then he carefully closed his hand over the price mark on the necklace so that she could not see it. How could he tell her the price? The happy look in her big blue eyes struck him like the pain of an old wound. ""Just a minute,"" he said and went to the back of the shop. ""What's your name?"" he called out. He was very busy about something. ""Jean Grace,"" answered the child. When Pete returned to the front of the shop, he held a package in his hand. It was wrapped in pretty Christmas paper. ""There you are,"" he said. ""Don't lose it on the way home."" She smiled happily at him as she ran out of the door. Through the window he watched her go. He felt more alone than ever.

"Every month, Julia and her cousins would go to visit their grandparents. They would be excited because their grandfather would give them a few coins. Then they would buy toys and sweets. The grandparents commented that, behaving like this, the children would never learn to manage their money. So they planned a special test, in which the children would have to show, over the course of a year, just what they could manage to get with those few coins. Some thought that they would save their money, but Rubin and Nico continued spending it all on sweets. So they give up saving. Monty decided to manage his money by exchanging it: buying and selling things, or bettering it with others. Soon he surprised the whole family. He had accumulated lots of money. However, Monty was not very careful, and he got involved in more and more risky deals. A few months later he became penniless after a losing bet. Alex, had a will of iron. He saved the money and at the end of the year he had collected more money than anyone. Even better, with so much money, he had managed to buy sweets at a reduced price, so that on the day of the competition he was presented with enough sweets for more than a year. And even then, he still had enough left for a toy. He was the clear winner, and other children learnt the advantages of knowing how to save and how to wait. There was also Julia. Poor Julia didn't enjoy the competition because even though she had a wonderful secret plan, she had spent her money without giving her plan enough time to work. However, she was so sure that her plan was a good one, that she decided to carry on with it, and maybe change the expressions on her  s' faces, who had seemed to be saying ""What a disaster that girl is.

"I have heard having a good sense of humour often helps in breaking the ice. Also people remember you because of your humour. But I think I don't have a very good sense of humour. Could you suggest how to build on this? ----Radha Karnik This is a great question that is unfortunately difficult to answer. I can only give you my views on this topic, which may or may not be correct. I know that my sense of humour developed over time. When I was younger I was not funny at all, now I can easily make people laugh. At the same time, sometimes I say things that I think are very funny but others do not. Improving wit and humour, I believe, is an ongoing process. Now, there are various forms of humour and everyone has their individual style. Overall, I believe being fluent in a language is very important for being witty or funny. The way we play around with words adds the ""funny"" tag to an otherwise normal sentence. Also, seeing irony is very important. I think humour is often the link between two unrelated things. In my experience, laughing frequently and appreciating other people's jokes and wit are very important. Within these, finding humour in everyday normal situations is the key. I often notice what is going on around me and say funny things in my head and laugh to myself. That serves almost as practice for when I am in a group. I watch comedy shows and movies and I am sure that has some effect on helping me improve my sense of humour. And last, having confidence that you are witty is important. There will always be someone wittier or funnier than you, which is fine. Just work on building your own style.

"People used to think that wetlands were wasted land. Developers would drain them with ditches ,fill them in with tons of soil,and build houses,schools,and parking areas on them.Then scientists began to realize the important role wetlands played in the environment. Wetlands act like giant sponges  during storms.They soak up extra storm water and afterward release it slowly back into the water cycle.This helps prevent flooding. Towns where people have drained wetlands have found that in a big storm,their streets and homes are often flooded because there are no wetlands to soak up the excess water. Wetlands also act as giant filters where pollutants are absorbed and dissolved over time.Though wetlands can become polluted from dumping,wastewater,and fertilizer runoff from farm fields,they are able to process some pollutants over time because of all the microorganisms and plants living there. Wetlands are especially important for providing homes and breeding grounds to millions of birds,fish,and amphibians worldwide. Many wetlands have become national wildlife refuges ,where you can go to take pictures and look at birds and animals. The Everglades are a huge wetland that once covered more than four million acres of southern Florida. Sometimes called the ""river of grass"",the Everglades are a shallow sheet of water that slowly flowed across a grassy plain. In the late 1800s people began draining parts of the Everglades for development. Roads were built and towns sprang up.The Everglades shrank to half its original size. Cities like Miami grew up where once there was a thriving wetland. Sewage and waste from the cities were pumped into the remaining wetlands. Over time scientists began to see the importance of the Everglades. Even with its smaller size,the Everglades filtered the pollutants coming from the cities,absorbing the worst of it like a sewage treatment plant. During storms the Everglades protected the cities from storm surge flooding. They also are just a great place to visit and see wildlife.

Psychologists Dr Brenda Todd from City University London carried out an experiment involving 90 babies aged 9 months to 36 months. The babies were allowed to choose from seven toys. Some were typically boys' toys ---- a car, a digger, a ball and a blue teddy. The rest were girls' toys: a pink teddy, a doll and a cooking set. They were placed a meter away from the toys;and could pick whichever toy they liked their choice and the amount of time they spent playing with each toy were recorded. Of the youngest children (9 to 14 months), girls spent significantly longer playing with the doll than boys, and boys spent much more time with the car and ball than the girls did. Among the two and three-year-olds, girls spent 50 percent of the time playing with the doll while only two boys briefly touched it. The boys spent almost 90 percent of their time playing with cars, which the girls barely touched. There was no link between the parents' view on which toys were more appropriate for boys or girls, and the children's choice. Dr Brenda Todd said, ""Children of this age are already exposed to much socialization. Boys may be given 'toys that go' while girls get toys they can care for, which may help shape their preference. But these findings agree with the former idea that children show natural interests in particular kinds of toys. There could be a biological basis for their choices. Males through evolution have been adapted to prefer: moving objects, probably through hunting instincts , while girls prefer warmer colors such as pink, the colour of a newborn baby.""

"Decision-making can be extremely difficult. Decision-making styles are significantly different in different cultures. In any approach to a problem and in any negotiations, the Western world turns to the""I to you"" approach while Japan,the ""you to you"" approach. The former means both sides present their arguments openly from their own point of view. Naturally, often comes a conflict situation, which Westerners are very skillful in dealing with.The latter is based on each side trying to understand the other person's point of view. Thus, the direction of the meeting is a mutual  attempt to reduce confrontation and achieve harmony. Besides, Western decision-making goes mostly from top management and often does not consult middle management or the worker. However, in Japan great consideration is given to the thoughts and opinions of everyone at all levels. Based on ""bottom-up direction"", ideas can be created at the lowest levels, travel upward through an organization and have an effect on the final decision. Difference in decision-making also comes from different communication styles. The Japanese business person works to achieve harmony, even if the deal fallsthrough, and will spend whatever time is necessary to determine a ""you to you"" approach, communicating personal views only indirectly. They put a thorough job above the Western deadline approach. So the Japanese are thorough in their meetings. Thus Americans are often annoyed by the many meetings in many Japanese businesses. But where the American is pressingfor a specific decision, the Japanese is trying to think up a rather broad direction. On the other hand, once a given agreement is made, it is the Japanese who sometimes wonderat the slow pace in which Westerners carry out the decision.

"Seventeenth-century houses in colonial North American were simple structures that were primarily functional, carrying over traditional designs that went back to the Middle Ages.  During the first half of the eighteen century, however, houses began to show a new elegance.  As wealth increased, more and more colonist built fine houses.    Since architecture was not yet a specialized profession in the colonies, the design of buildings was left either to amateur   designers or to carpenters who were engaged in translating architectural handbooks imported from England.  Inventories of libraries shows an astonishing number of these handbooks for builders, and the houses built during the eighteenth century show their influence.  Nevertheless, most household architecture of the first-quarters of the eighteenth century displays a wide  _ of taste and freedom of application of the rules laid down in these books.    Increasing wealth and growing sophistication   throughout the colonies resulted in houses of improved design, whether the material was wood, stone, or brick.  New England still favored wood, though brick houses became common in Boston and other towns, where the danger of fire gave an impetus   to the use of more durable material.  A few houses in New England were built of stone, but only in Pennsylvania and areas nearby was stone widely used in buildings.  An increased use of brick in houses and outbuildings is noticeable in Virginia and Maryland, but wood remained the most popular material even in houses built by wealthy landowners.  In the Carolinas, even in closely packed Charleston, wooden houses were much common than brick houses.    Eighteenth-century houses showed great interior improvements over the former ones.  Windows were made larger and shutters removed.  Large, clear panes replaced the small leaded glass of the seventeenth century.  Doorways were larger and more decorative.    Fireplaces became decorative features of rooms.  Walls were made of plaster or wood.  White paint began to take the place of blues, yellows, greens, and lead color1s, which had been popular for walls in the earlier years.  After about 1730, advertisements for wallpaper styles in scenic patterns began to appear in colonial newspapers.

"""Colour"" and ""color"",""favourite"" and ""favorite""... Have you ever wondered why Americans spell those words without a ""u""? Is it because they are lazy? Of course not. In fact,the difference in spelling was created by Noah Webster (1758-1843). He is a teacher who reformed English to make American identity stronger. Linguists   celebrated his 250th birthday on October 16. After the Revolutionary War (1775~ 1783),Webster believed that Americans should have their own dictionary,rather than rely on British versions  . He dropped the British ""u"" in some words. And he changed ""centre"" into ""center"" for children to learn English by spelling words more like they sounded. Webster wasn't shy about expressing his opinions. In defining   preposterous (unreasonable),he wrote: ""A republican government in the hands of females is preposterous."" Webster spent 28 years on the project before completing the 70,000-word dictionary in 1828 with his American-style spellings. He also added local words. His dictionary was widely used in schools. Linguists believed it helped a new nation achieve unity and cultural independence at a time when most were focused on political freedom.

"Shay asked, ""Do you think they'll let me play?"" Shay's father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but the father also understood that if his son, mentally and physically disabled, were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence. Shay's father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play, not expecting much. The boy looked around and said, ""We're losing by six runs   and the game is in the eighth inning  .I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the final inning. Shay struggled over to the team's bench and put on a team shirt with a broad smile and his father had a small tear in his eye and warmth in heart. The boys saw the father's joy at his son being accepted. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three. In the top of the final inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously joyful just to be in the game and on the field. In the bottom of the final inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, Shay was scheduled to be next at bat. Would they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game? Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was almost impossible. The first pitch   came and Shay missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to throw the ball softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher. The pitcher could have easily thrown he ball to the first baseman and Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game .Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the head of the first baseman, beyond the reach of all teammates, The audience and the players from both teams started screaming, ""Shay, run to first! "" Never in his life had Shay ever run that far but made it to first base, wide-eyed and shocked.. Everyone should, ""Run to second!"" Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second. By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the smallest guy on their team, who had a chance to be the hero for his team for the first time, could have thrown the ball to the second baseman, but he understood the pitcher's intentions and he too intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third baseman's head.

The boys saw the father's joy at his son being accepted. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three. In the top of the final inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the field. Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously joyful just to be in the game and on the field. In the bottom of the final inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, Shay was scheduled to be next at bat. Would they let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game? Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was almost impossible. The first pitch   came and Shay missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to throw the ball softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher. The pitcher could have easily thrown he ball to the first baseman and Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game .Instead, the pitcher threw the ball right over the head of the first baseman, beyond the reach of all teammates, The audience and the players from both teams started screaming, ""Shay, run to first! "" Never in his life had Shay ever run that far but made it to first base, wide-eyed and shocked.. Everyone should, ""Run to second!"" Catching his breath, Shay awkwardly ran towards second. By the time Shay rounded towards second base, the smallest guy on their team, who had a chance to be the hero for his team for the first time, could have thrown the ball to the second baseman, but he understood the pitcher's intentions and he too intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third baseman's head. All were screaming,""Shay,Shay,Shay,all the way Shay."" Shay reached third base when one opposing player ran to help him and shouted, ""Shay, run to third."" As Shay rounded third, all were on their feet, crying,""Shay, run home!""Shay ran to home, stepped on the home base and was cheered as the hero who the who won the game for his team. That day, the boys from both teams helped bring a piece true love and humanity into this world. Shay didn't make it to another summer and died that winter, having never forgotten being the hero and making his father so happy and coming home and seeing his mother tearfully hug her little hero of the day! Which of the following has nothing to do with Shay's becoming the hero for his team?",The pitcher did not throw the ball to the first baseman.,The audience and the players from both teams cheered for him.,The opposing players failed to stop his running to home.,One of the opposing players ran to help him.,C
"Shay asked, ""Do you think they'll let me play?"" Shay's father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but the father also understood that if his son, mentally and physically disabled, were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging and some confidence. Shay's father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play, not expecting much. The boy looked around and said, ""We're losing by six runs   and the game is in the eighth inning  .I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the final inning.

What to you think is the theme of the story?",True human nature could be realized in the way we treat each other.,Everyone has his own strength even if mentally or physically disabled.,Everyone can develop his team spirit in sports and please his parents.,The results of the game should not be the only concern of the players.,A
"Why I Don't Spare ""Spare Change"" ""Poor but honest."" ""The deserving poor. "" These words always come to my mind when I think of ""the poor. "" But I also think of people who, perhaps through alcohol or drugs, have ruined not only their own lives but also the lives of others in order to give way to their own pleasure. Perhaps alcoholism and drug addiction really are ""diseases.

"" And that is largely why I don't give spare change to beggars. But surely among the street people there are also some who can rightly be called ""deserving."" Deserving what? My spare change? Or simply the government's assistance? It happens that I have been brought up to believe that it is proper to make contributions to charity , but if I give some change to a beggar, am I making a contribution to charity and thereby helping someone, or, am I perhaps simply encouraging someone not to get help? Or, maybe even worse, am I supporting a cheat? If one believes in the value of private charity, one can either give to needy people or to charitable organizations. In giving to a beggar one may indeed be helping a person who badly needs help, but one cannot be certain that one is giving to a needy person. In giving to an organization, on the other hand, one can feel that one's money is likely to beused wisely. True, facing a beggar one may feel thatthis particular unfortunateperson needs help atthis moment-a cup of coffee or a sandwich-and the need will not be met unless I put my hand in my pocket right now. But I have come to think that the beggars whom I meet can get along without my spare change, and indeed perhaps they are actually better off for not having money to buy alcohol or drugs. I know nothing about these beggars, but it's my impression that they simply prefer begging to working. I am not generalizing about street people. I am talking about the people whom I actually meet. That's why I do not give ""spare change, "" and I don't think I will in the future. What does the author think of beggars who take drugs?",They should be given a cheek-up.,They really need money to live.,They have no pleasure in life.,They are not worth helping.,D

"It is the summer of 1776. Thomas Jefferson is not happy. He'd rather be home in Virginia than attending Philadelphia's Continental Congress  Thomas Jefferson knew he had a job to do.

But  Jefferson wasn't happy. Jefferson wanted to be home that hot summer of 1776. he missed his wife, Martha. She hadn't been feeling well when he left, and he worried about her.

Jefferson probably knew what was coming next. Here was another resolution  to debate. And whenever there was a resolution, there was a declaration. The American colonies had been at war with Great Britain for more than a year, but surprisingly. The colonies had not formally announced their independence. So the Congress appointed a five-man committee to crate a document declaring America's independence. And the committee chose Thomas Jefferson to write it. Jefferson knew he was to list the unfair things Great Britain had done to the colonies. For days and days,, Jefferson wrote and rewrote about the king and his unfair laws. About independence. About freedom. He borrowed ideas from other political writers, but he wrote these thoughts in words that all people could understand. He wanted his ideas to be shared with everyone. And  _ were. The Continental Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. on July 8, it was read out loud to a cheering crowd. No one knew who the author was, but they knew what the Declaration stood for-independence and freedom for all. Still, Thomas Jefferson dreamed of home. In late July he begged Richard Henry Lee to replace him in the Congress. In September, Jefferson's dream finally came true, and he traveled home. Since then, the words Thomas Jefferson wrote during that hot Philadelphia summer have inspired people throughout the world. Thank goodness Jefferson didn't go home.

"Everybody hates it, but everybody does it. A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a $16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food $2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, ""In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off."" This passage is mainly about   _  .",different kinds of tipping in different countries,the relationship between tipping and custom,the origin and present meaning of tipping,most American people hate tipping,C

"Have you ever heard the old saying, ""Never judge a book by its cover.""? This is a good rule to follow when trying to judge the intelligence of others. Some people have minds that shine only in certain situations. A young man with an unusual gift in writing may find himself speechless before a pretty girl when he speaks. He may not be able to find the right words. But don't make the mistake of thinking him stupid. With a pen and paper, he can express himself better than anybody else. Other people may fool you into overestimating  their intelligence by putting up a good front. A student who listens attentively and takes notes in class is bound to   make a favorable impression on his teachers. But when it comes to exams, he may score near the bottom of the class. In a word, you can't judge someone by appearance. The only way to determine a person's intelligence is to get to know him. Then you can see how he reacts to different situations. The more situations you see, the better your judgment is likely to be. So take your time. Don't judge a book by its cover. The passage suggests that   _  .",a good writer may not be a good speaker,a good writer is always a good speaker,a speechless person always writes well,a good writer will find himself speechless,A

"Warning: reading too much Cinderella  to your daughter may damage her emotional health in later life. A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy  in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused  by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel  and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults. The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way.     The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero. Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. ""They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,"" she said."" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners."" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. ""The question,"" said Ms Darker Smith, ""is why she did not break the door down herself.""

Cinderella, Rapunzel and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast are similar in that   _  .",They all married some princes,They all changed their partners with love,They were all abused by their partners,They all put up with abuse,D
"Warning: reading too much Cinderella  to your daughter may damage her emotional health in later life. A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy  in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused  by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel  and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults. The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way.     The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero. Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. ""They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,"" she said."" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners."" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. ""The question,"" said Ms Darker Smith, ""is why she did not break the door down herself."" Which of the following statements is true of the women in a control group?",They don't believe in fairy tales.,They don't believe in the transformational qualities of love.,They have also experienced abuse.,They survived abuse.,B
"When I was young, I wished for a good car and a big house. That was my idea of success. I took all the advanced classes and tried to do well in the exams with my mind set on going to a key school. I just knew that I would somehow become famous and be able to afford the car and the dream house. All the way through junior years, my mind was planning this beautiful future. Then in the eleventh grade, many losses changed my mind. First, one of my friends died at 16. Soon after, my great-grandmother passed away, followed by my beloved fourth-grade teacher. These events left me not knowing what to do or where to go . Death had never touched me so closely. After a long period of emptiness, it finally struck me: Life is not promised and neither is future success. Though I was attempting to achieve material success, I was not enjoying my daily life. I realized that finding inner peace, purpose and happiness will stick with me forever and that is real success. Enjoying life's precious quirks (  ) makes an ordinary person more successful than a wealthy person who isn't content and takes everything for granted. The summer before senior years, my attitude changed greatly. Instead of memorizing facts, I began learning skills. Instead of focusing on the future, I focused on today and the many blessings and successes that came with it. I still get excellent grades, but now I devote weeks to studying instead of struggling for exams, and I think about the future with a deeper sense of meaning. For me, being successful means truly living life each day. The reason why the author changed his idea of success is that   _   .",he can't afford his house,his beloved teacher was dead,he didn't know what to do or where to go,he lost a few beloved persons in a short time,D

"The ocean bottom, a region nearly 2.5 times greater than the total land area of the earth, is even today largely unexplored. Until about a century ago, the deep ocean floor was completely inaccessible and hidden beneath waters averaging over 3,600 meters deep. Totally without light and in the case of intense pressures hundreds of times greater than at the earth's surface, the deep-ocean bottom is a strange environment to humans, in some way as frightening and remote as the outer space. Although researchers have taken samples of deep-ocean rocks for over a century, the first detailed global study of the ocean bottom did not actually start until 1969, with the beginning of the National Science Foundation's Deep Sea Drilling Project(DSDP). Using techniques first developed for the offshore oil and gas industry, the DSDP's drill ship, the Glomar Challenger, was able to maintain a steady position on the ocean's surface and drill very deep waters, taking samples of rocks from the ocean floor. The Glomar Challenger completed 96 voyages in a 15-year research program that ended in November 1983. During this time, it sailed 600,000 kilometers and took almost 20,000 samples of rocks around the world. Those samples have allowed geologists to reconstruct what the planet looked like hundreds of millions of years ago and to make out what it will probably look like millions of years in the future. Today, largely on the strength of evidence gathered during the Glomar Challenger's voyages, nearly all earth scientists agree on the theories of plate tectonics   and continental drift that explain many of the geological processes. The sample of rocks drilled by the Glomar Challenger have also provided a climatic record stretching back hundreds of millions of years. The information of past climatic change can be used to predict the future climate. Which of the following is TRUE about the Glomar Challenger?",It is a military submarine.,It is used to develop tourism.,It has gone on over 100 voyages.,It made its first DSDP voyage in 1969.,D

"Once upon a time there was a wise man that used to go to the ocean to do his writing. He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work. One day he was walking along the shore. As he looked down the beach, he saw a human figure moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself at the thought that someone would dance on the beach. So he began to walk faster to catch up. As he got closer, he saw that it was a young man and the young man wasn't dancing, but instead he was reaching down to the shore, picking up something and very gently throwing it into the ocean. As he got closer he called out, ""Good morning! What are you doing?"" The young man paused, looked up and replied, ""Throwing starfish in the ocean.""""I guess I should have asked, why are you throwing starfish in the ocean?""""The sun is up and the tide is going out, and if I don't throw them in they'll die."" ""But, young man, don't you realize that there are miles and miles of beach and starfish all along it. You can't possibly make a difference!"" The young man listened politely, then he bent down, picked another starfish and threw it into the sea, past the breaking waves and said, ""It made a difference for that one."" There is in each and every one of us. We have all been gifted with the ability to make a difference.

"Security--for the information on your smartphone, as well as for the phone itself---is a hot topic these days. The truth is that you're packing a lot of sensitive information on your phone, and you should keep it safe. When it comes to physical security, iPhone users would do well to download Find My iPhone, a free app from Apple that allows you to visit a website and see your (lost, stolen or misplaced) phone on the map. You can then sound an alarm, send a message that will pop up on its screen, lock the phone or erase all your data. Android does not have an exact equivalent , but there are plenty of alternatives. A free app called Lookout offers the find-my-phone feature. The paid version allows you to wipe the data from your phone remotely. Then there is your coffee shop's WiFi network. Anyone with minimal technical expert skill can snoop on  people using shared wireless networks, harvesting passwords and other personal data. Lookout's apps will caution you when you've logged on to an insecure network, but cannot protect you once you're there. In order to protect yourself on such networks, you can use a virtual private network, or V.P.N. This turns all your activity into nonsense to anyone trying to read along with you from across the Starbucks. It also keeps websites from tracking you and, if you're traveling, allows you to get access to sites that may be blocked in other countries. If you have an iPhone, the simplest V.P.N. app is probably Hotspot Shield, whose distinguishing feature is said to be that it automatically kicks in each time you start browsing  , as opposed to other V.P.N. apps that require you to start them up manually . This matters, because even if you decide you want a V.P.N. app, you want to spend approximately zero time thinking about it. For the most part, _ was true of Hotspot Shield, though occasionally it took a while to connect or temporarily lost connection without warning. I found myself having to turn the app on and off sometimes, which involved setting my phone constantly. If even reading about the setting on your phone drives you crazy, then it is probably best to stay away from a V.P.N. app. But if you're the type who can't resist checking your bank balance from your comer bar, the hassle   may be preferable to the risk. Which of the following can warn you against the insecure network?",Android,V.P.N.,Lookout,Find My iPhone,C

"When we give our kids holiday gifts, many of us can't wait to hear their appreciative cries of""thank you!""once the wrapping gets ripped off. But here's a tip: You'd be wise not to expect much gratitude from them for what they receive. Gratitude can make us happier, healthier, and even fitter. But do the kids show their gratitude for the stuff we buy them? All the research I've done has convinced me that it won't happen. One mom told me that when she asked her 16-year-old son to thank her for buying him a cellphone, he said, ""But that's what moms should do."" From a teenager's angle, it's a parent's responsibility to take care of the family. According to Dunham, Yale's assistant professor of psychology, ""When teenagers code it that way, a gift is no longer something given freely and voluntarily""--it's just mom and dad living up to their obligation. Parents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view. Show by example that gratitude isn't aboutstuff--which ultimately can't make any of us happy anyway.It's about realizing how lucky you are and paying your good fortune forward. You can collect all the charitable appeals and sit down together with the kids to go through them. You set the budget for giving and the kids decide how it's distributed. Once the conversation about gratitude gets started, it's much easier to continue all year. Also you can set up a family routine at bedtime where kids describe three things that have made them grateful. When kids go off to college, you can text them a picture each week of something that inspires your appreciation. Teaching children to focus on the positive and appreciate the good in their lives is perhaps the greatest gift we can give them. And we can all learn together that the things that really matter aren't on sale at a department store. How do children respond when receiving gifts from their parents?",They show no interest in their parents' gifts.,They can't wait to open their parents' gifts.,They show much gratitude to their parents for the gifts.,They take their parents' gifts for granted.,D

"Last week Adele's second album, 21, sold 257,000 copies in the UK, a sales figure that would look incredible as an opening sales week for any album by any global superstar. The fact that the album was celebrating its 10th week at No.1, and that each of the previous nine weeks it had sold over 100,000 copies, makes what Adele has achieved look miraculous. The last female singer to spend that long at No.1 in the UK was Madonna in 1990 with her greatest hits compilation, The Immaculate Collection. For Adele, the success of 21 is part of a perfect storm of talent, timing and a connection that went beyond gender, age and credibility. But what does it say about the state of the music industry? Does Adele's success signal a return to the MOR  musical depression, when the likes of James Blunt dominated the charts? Her success may well lead to a great many similar acts aiming for an MOR audience, but that's more the fault of an industry desperate to recreate any kind of success by creating poor copies until the world shouts ""stop now"". What seems to have set Adele apart is her apparent ordinariness, besides that incredible voice. While Gaga parades around in a dress made of meat and Beyonce orbits a world out of touch to the majority of most human beings, Adele's chain-smoking, girl-you'd-like-to-go-to-the-pub-with persona stands out. Even for a British act, her ordinariness goes against trend, with fellow Jessie J adopting a very American habit of over-emoting, talking about a ""journey"" and making the idea of being a pop star seem fairly difficult. It's this universality and broad appeal that's helped her translate talent into sales. While the first single from 21, Rolling in the Deep, appealed to Radio 1 listeners and bloggers, the second single, Someone Like You, is so successful that silenced the grand O2 Arena during this year's Brit Awards. The press can write pages and pages in that there's enough of a connection of musicians - Rick Rubin worked on the album, there's a cover of the Cure, Mumford & Sons were an influence - while the gossip magazines have been excited by the fact that the album is one long break-up record, eager to find the ex. In 1990, Madonna was a global superstar with a back catalogue of era-defining hits to her name. She was untouchable and, tellingly, unknowable. She was (and still is) a megastar, but a megastar of a different age. These days, we want to know a bit more about our artists; that they have relationship problems, walk their dog. Her selling point and appeal is precisely the fact that she exists at the point between everyday ordinariness and pop star. For now, Adele's success should be celebrated, especially for becoming an unlikely global star on her own terms. The danger is that we're headed for a lot of fairly boring pop, a situation that led to the ""birth"" of Gaga a few years back. Pop goes in cycles and it feels like we're headed back towards the very middle of MOR. Adele's achievement seems unbelievable for the reason that   _  .",the sales of her second album achieved an incredible success last week in the UK,her second album ranked first in a row with the incredible average sales per week,Madonna was the last female singer in the UK to stay at No. 1 as long as she did,she is such an ordinary singer with so fascinating a voice in the music industry,B

"Last week Adele's second album, 21, sold 257,000 copies in the UK, a sales figure that would look incredible as an opening sales week for any album by any global superstar. The fact that the album was celebrating its 10th week at No.1, and that each of the previous nine weeks it had sold over 100,000 copies, makes what Adele has achieved look miraculous. The last female singer to spend that long at No.1 in the UK was Madonna in 1990 with her greatest hits compilation, The Immaculate Collection. For Adele, the success of 21 is part of a perfect storm of talent, timing and a connection that went beyond gender, age and credibility. But what does it say about the state of the music industry? Does Adele's success signal a return to the MOR  musical depression, when the likes of James Blunt dominated the charts? Her success may well lead to a great many similar acts aiming for an MOR audience, but that's more the fault of an industry desperate to recreate any kind of success by creating poor copies until the world shouts ""stop now"". What seems to have set Adele apart is her apparent ordinariness, besides that incredible voice. While Gaga parades around in a dress made of meat and Beyonce orbits a world out of touch to the majority of most human beings, Adele's chain-smoking, girl-you'd-like-to-go-to-the-pub-with persona stands out. Even for a British act, her ordinariness goes against trend, with fellow Jessie J adopting a very American habit of over-emoting, talking about a ""journey"" and making the idea of being a pop star seem fairly difficult. It's this universality and broad appeal that's helped her translate talent into sales. While the first single from 21, Rolling in the Deep, appealed to Radio 1 listeners and bloggers, the second single, Someone Like You, is so successful that silenced the grand O2 Arena during this year's Brit Awards. The press can write pages and pages in that there's enough of a connection of musicians - Rick Rubin worked on the album, there's a cover of the Cure, Mumford & Sons were an influence - while the gossip magazines have been excited by the fact that the album is one long break-up record, eager to find the ex. In 1990, Madonna was a global superstar with a back catalogue of era-defining hits to her name. She was untouchable and, tellingly, unknowable. She was (and still is) a megastar, but a megastar of a different age. These days, we want to know a bit more about our artists; that they have relationship problems, walk their dog. Her selling point and appeal is precisely the fact that she exists at the point between everyday ordinariness and pop star. For now, Adele's success should be celebrated, especially for becoming an unlikely global star on her own terms. The danger is that we're headed for a lot of fairly boring pop, a situation that led to the ""birth"" of Gaga a few years back. Pop goes in cycles and it feels like we're headed back towards the very middle of MOR.

"Do we think only with the brain? Hardly. The brain is like a telephone exchange. It is the switchboard, but not the whole system. Its function is to receive incoming signals, make proper connections, and send the messages through to their destination. For efficient service, the body must function as a whole. But where is the ""mind""? Is it in the brain or perhaps in the nervous system? After all, can we say that the mind is in any particular place? It is not a thing, like a leg, or even the brain. It is a function, an activity. Aristotle, twenty-three hundred years ago, observed that the mind was to the body what cutting was to the ax. When the ax is not in use, there is no cutting.

"As rain begins to fall from the clouds, it is very pure. However, as it falls through the air it dissolves some of the gases in the air. It also collects bits of dust and microbes   that are floating in the air. When the rain reaches the ground it begins to pick up more dust and dirt. Many kinds of mineral substances   dissolve in the water. Sand and mud cannot dissolve in water.    Since water is so important to us, it is very important that the water we use should be clean. Otherwise, we might get some of the diseases that are carried by water. Many microbes are harmful. They are so small that we cannot see them. These microbes must be removed or killed before the water is suitable for drinking. For example, microbes of diseases like cholera live well in water. If the water supply is not clean, people who drink this water may get these diseases. Thus, to provide people with clean water, the government purifies   the water.   Purification is a long process and includes three stages: storing, purifying and distributing . The first stage is storing. Man-made lakes are used for this purpose. Water from the rains, other lakes, streams and rivers is collected in the lakes. This water is usually dirty and muddy.    In the second stage, water from the man-made lakes is filtered   in a special pond. Stones, sand and other unwanted tiny things are caught in it. After that, tiny microbes are still present in the water. These microbes are removed by ""airing"" the water and by adding a chemical substance called chlorine   to the water. This kills all the microbes in the water. After this, the water can be safely used for drinking. The third stage is the distribution of the purified water to homes, hospitals, offices, factories and other places. This is done through a network of pipes of various sizes. These pipes must be made of a suitable material. What can we know about man-made lakes?",It is used through the whole process of purification.,Only rain water can be collected and stored in it.,Water collected can be stored and filtered in it.,Water from it contains a lot of impure substances.,D

"One mile long runway can take people across the oceans, to reach every corner of the world. That's the magic power of airplanes as well as airports. Similar as most airports are, some do have their unique features. Lukla Airport Lukla Airport, is a small airport in the town of in the town of Lukla, eastern Nepal. A program titled Most Extreme Airports, rated the airport as the most dangerous airport in the world. The airport is popular because Lukla is the place where most people start the climb to Mount Everest Base Camp. High wind, cloud cover, and changing visibility often mean flights can be delayed or the airport closed. The airport's runway is accessible only to helicopters and small, fixed-wing, short-takeoff-and-landing aircraft. The runway is only 527m with an elevation of 2,845m. Princess Juliana International Airport Princess Juliana International Airport is in the country of Saint Maarten. The airport is perhaps best known for very low-altitude flyover landing approaches due to one end of its runway being extremely close to the shore and Maho Beach. The thrilling approaches and ease of access for shooting spectacular images make the airport one of the world's favorite places among plane spotters. Gibraltar Airport Gibraltar Airport serves the British overseas territory of Gibraltar, a tiny peninsula with an area of only 6.8 square kilometers. The lack of flat space there means the peninsula's only runway is bisected by its busiest road, the Winston Churchill Avenue that heads towards the land border with Spain. It is really scary that there is a four lane highway passing through the middle of the runway! Kai Tak Airport Kai Tak Airport was officially known as Hong Kong International Airport from 1954 to 6 July 1998, when it was closed and replaced by the new one at Chek Lap Kok, 30 kms to the west. With numerous skyscrapers and mountains located to the north and its only runway jutting out into Victoria Harbour, landing at the airport were dramatic to experience and technically demanding for pilots.

The low altitude manoeuvre required to line up with the runway was so spectacular that some passengers claimed to have glimpsed the television through apartment windows along the final approach. Which of these airports is out of business now?",Lukla Airport,Princess Juliana International Airport,Gibraltar Airport,Kai Tak Airport,D
"The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: "" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition."" Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. The Norwegian Government would prefer the oil industry to   _  .",provide more jobs for foreign workers,slow down the rate of its development,sell the oil it is producing abroad,develop more quickly than at present,B

"Climbing to the Top     The year 2013 is the 60th anniversary of the first successful climb to Qomolangma. Do you know why so many people wanted to reach the top of the world?      It was breathtaking. It was wonderful and a bit of frightening. It was Qomolangma, the highest mountain in the world. For many years, it has attracted tens of thousands of people who tried to climb its dangerous slopes. During May's 60th anniversary of the first successful climb, nearly 600 people from around the world, including a 5-year-old Italian boy, tried to reach the ""roof of the world"". China Central Television(CCTV) also sent a team to join the adventure. It broadcasted a special program, called ""Standing at the world's third pole in 2013"", from May 18 to 24 to cover the Chinese climbing Qomolangma. Over the last century, the 8848-metre-high peak has proven a great challenge for mountaineers. Those who try to stand on top of the world do so at great risk from extremely cold, avalanches , and falling ice. At 8,500 meters, the air contains just one-third of the oxygen at sea level, requiring most climbers to use oxygen tanks. Some of those who climbed the mountain paid the highest price---175 people have lost their lives on the slopes.      On May29, 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary from New Zealand and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal became the first men ever to reach the top of the mountain. Nearly half a century later, the sons of the two pioneers, Peter Hillary and Jaming Tenzing Norgay, followed in their fathers' footsteps. In 2002, they also successfully reached the roof of the world.      Over the last 60 years, more than 10,000 men and women have tried to climb the mountain and more than 1,200 have succeeded. The first Chinese climbers reached the top of the mountain in 1960.      Despite the dangers, many different people are drawn towards the challenge. But why do they suffer such hardship and take such risks to climb Qomolangma?      ""I don't think climbing the mountain is blindly risky. Instead, it's a chance to challenge oneself,"" said Chen Qi, a reporter of CCTV. Com, who was among May's mountaineering team.      ""Only when you are surrounded by the mountain can you understand the love of nature and the true meaning of life."" Which sentence is right according to the passage?",Nearly 600 people lost their lives on the slopes of Qomolangma.,The first men ever to reach the top of the mountain are from different countries.,The first Chinese climbers reached the top of the mountain in 1953.,"More than 10,000 men and women have succeeded in climbing to the top of the mountain.",B

"Fahad Azad, an engineer in India, invented a robot named DuctBot.The toy-car sized DuctBot measured 23 centimeters in length, 19 centimeters in width and 9 centimeters in height and weighs just two kilograms. The robot is designed to snake through dark, narrow air conditioning ducts   and clean them.A pair of LEDs fitted on the robot light up the dirty scenery, so _ can be captured   by a camera. In order to control it more easily, Mr. Azad chooses to fix DuctBot on wheels.The robot can clean off lots of dirt, as well as dead pigeons and insects.Keeping indoor air in good quality and monitoring carbon-dioxide levels in buildings with central air conditioning is a challenge.It is important in some places where clean air can mean a difference between life and death, such as hospitals.Dirty air has a bad influence on people's health. EPSCO, a Dubai-based company which specializes in improving indoor air quality, read about Mr. Azad's invention in a national newspaper after he had won an international robotics competition.EPSCO had cleaning equipment, but it needed someone to get into those ducts to do the dirty, dangerous work.Across India, for example, the task still falls to children.They are small enough to go through those ducts. In 2005, Mr. Azad who was still at university decided to do something about it.Six years later his own company, Robosoft Systems, has Bluestar, EPSCO and the Indian Navy, some leading air condition makers, as partners. Mr. Azad and his ten employees are currently exploring robot designs to examine oil tanks or sewage  pipes.Their biggest challenge is to make the robots user-friendly enough.Mr. Azad hopes that the robot could eventually be operated not by engineers but by workers.There will be lots of difficulties they need to overcome in the future. What can we learn about Ductbot?",It is a toy car and popular with children.,It is designed to move like a snake in the ducts.,many LEDs are fitted on it to tell its location.,It is actually a camera to capture dirty scenery.,B

"One of the worst feelings you have as a professional athlete is the feeling after losing a game to a team that you should have beaten. That happened last night against the lowly Boston Celtics. They had only won 13 games the whole year and were really struggling. We had just come off a very good win against the Orlando Magic on the road and were feeling good about ourselves. The day did not start out good for us when we learned that T-Mac was going to miss the game with the flu. When you lose your best players (Yao, T-Mac) everyone must play a little harder and do a little bit more on the floor. We inserted Bonzi Wells into the lineup (he was the only one to have a good game for us), in place of T-Mac. It was a nasty game. We are usually one of the best three point shooting teams in the NBA and we only made 1 of 22 three point shots! I have never seen that happen. Never! Rafer Alston, Luther Head, and me combined to shoot 5 of 33 from the field. Ouch! You aren't going to win too many games like that. Even as poorly as we shot the ball, we STILL had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but failed to make the winning plays that you must make to leave the floor victorious. In the locker room after the game, everybody felt terrible. When we play a bad game, we feel that we let our teammates down. There is a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach when you leave the gym and you just want to go home and not talk to anyone.

"Science is a dominant theme in our culture. Since it touches almost every aspect of our life, educated people need at least some idea of its structure and operation. They should also have an understanding of the subculture in which scientists live and the kinds of people they are. An understanding of general characteristics of science as well as specific scientific concepts is easier to obtain if one knows something about the things that excite and frustrate the scientist. This book is written for the intelligent student or lay   person whose knowledge of science is superficial; for the person who has been presented with science as a musty storehouse of dried facts; for the person who sees the chief objective of science as the production of small devices; and for the person who views the scientists as some sort of magician. The book can be used to supplement a course in any science, to accompany any course that attempts to give an understanding of the modern world, or independently of any course, simply to provide a better understanding of science. We hope this book will lead readers to a broader perspective on scientific attitudes and a more realistic view of what science is, who scientists are, and what they do. It will give them an awareness and understanding of the relationship between science and our culture and an appreciation of the roles science may play in our culture. In addition, readers may learn to appreciate the relationship between scientific views and some of the values and philosophies that are widespread in our culture. We have tried to present in this book an accurate and up-to-date picture of the scientific community and the people who populate it. That population has in recent years come to consist of more and more women. This increasing role of women in the scientific subculture is not an unique incident but, rather, part of the trend evident in all parts of society as more women enter traditionally male-dominated fields and make significant contributions. In discussing these changes and contribution, however, we are faced with a language that is somewhat sexist, one that uses male nouns or pronouns in referring to unspecified individuals. To balance this built-in bias  , we have adopted the policy of using plural nouns and pronouns whenever possible and , when absolutely necessary, alternating him and her. This policy is far from being ideal, but it is at least an acknowledgement of the inadequacy of our language in treating half of the human race equally. We have also tried to make the book entertaining as well as informative. Our approach is usually informal. We feel, as many other scientists do, that we shouldn't take ourselves too seriously. As the reader may observe, we see science as a delightful pastime rather than as a grim and dreary way to earn a living. According to the passage, 'scientific subculture' means   _  .",cultural groups that are formed by scientists.,people whose knowledge of science is very limited,the scientific community,people who make good contribution to science,C

"Ever feel like there aren't enough hours in the day? A group of timechallenged Canadian women are wishing for a 25hour clock. Jessie Behan, president of the 25th Hour Coalition  which is a group of Canadian women who have changed to a longer day, said the struggle for women to maintain worklife balance motivated   her to research the body's natural clock.""Many of my girlfriends are having kids,getting married, and I see the sufferings of dealing all that when you're a working woman,""she said.""Women like myself are sick of living their lives by a 24hour clock."" A 2007 study by Charles Czeisler found a switch to longer days could be beneficial, especially for frequent travelers, shift workers, astronauts and those who experience trouble sleeping or waking. In a similar study, Czeisler showed the body's natural clock averages 24 hours and 11 minutes in both young and older people.The current 360degree clock has 720 minutes, giving each minute 0.5 degree.With the new 25hour day, 30 minutes is added to each 12hour period making each minute 0.48 degree. While still a relatively small movement-the 25th Hour Coalition has 160 Facebook members, Behan is hoping for large changes.""The goal is to get as many women on board; there's no harm in just trying it out and seeing.If it gets big, maybe the government will decide to standardize it."" A recent online survey by Reader's Digest, which included 150 people in each of the 13 countries, suggests it's not just Canadians looking for longer days.Readers were asked""what would you do with an extra hour""if given a choice between sleep, work, exercise and family time.In Spain, half of respondents  said they'd like an extra hour in the day to devote to family time.The same was found for respondents in Brazil, the US and Britain, who chose family time over sleep, which came in at a close second.Only in India did work top the list with 50 percent of respondents claiming they could use an extra hour at the office.

"If you and your friends wish to share a secret, you can write it in code, and no one else will be able to read it. Codes are one way of writing in secret. Ciphers   are another. In a code each word is written as a secret code word or a code number. In a cipher each letter is changed. Codes and ciphers have played an important role in the history of the world. Julius Caesar, the Roman ruler who defeated almost all the countries in Europe about 2,000 years ago, used a cipher when he sent secret messages to his troops. During the American Revolution, George Washington's spies used a kind of code to send his information about the enemy before his military action. In World War II, the Americans""broke""or figured out Japan's most important navy codes and got enough information to destroy a powerful Japanese fleet. Storekeepers use codes to mark their goods. The codes show how much is paid for the goods or when they are added to the stock. Businessmen use codes to hide plans from their business enemies. Sometimes personal letters or diaries are written in code. Many people enjoy figuring out codes and ciphers simply as a hobby. In the 16th century, codes and ciphers were very popular among scientists. They wrote messages to each other in code so that no one else would learn their secrets. Geronimo Gardano, an Italian astrologer  , mathematician, and doctor, invented the trellis cipher. He took two sheets of paper and cut exactly the same holes in each one. Then he sent one sheet, which he called a trellis, to a friend and kept the other for himself. Whenever he wanted to write a message, he put his trellis over a clean sheet of paper and wrote the secret message through the holes. There he removed the trellis and filled the rest of the paper with words that would make sense. When his friend received it, he put his trellis over the writing and read the secret message. The best title of this passage would be  _  .",Codes and ciphers,Differences between codes and ciphers,History of codes and ciphers,Inventors of codes and ciphers,A

In a code each word is written as a secret code word or a code number. In a cipher each letter is changed. Codes and ciphers have played an important role in the history of the world. Julius Caesar, the Roman ruler who defeated almost all the countries in Europe about 2,000 years ago, used a cipher when he sent secret messages to his troops. During the American Revolution, George Washington's spies used a kind of code to send his information about the enemy before his military action. In World War II, the Americans""broke""or figured out Japan's most important navy codes and got enough information to destroy a powerful Japanese fleet. Storekeepers use codes to mark their goods. The codes show how much is paid for the goods or when they are added to the stock. Businessmen use codes to hide plans from their business enemies. Sometimes personal letters or diaries are written in code. Many people enjoy figuring out codes and ciphers simply as a hobby. In the 16th century, codes and ciphers were very popular among scientists. They wrote messages to each other in code so that no one else would learn their secrets. Geronimo Gardano, an Italian astrologer  , mathematician, and doctor, invented the trellis cipher. He took two sheets of paper and cut exactly the same holes in each one. Then he sent one sheet, which he called a trellis, to a friend and kept the other for himself. Whenever he wanted to write a message, he put his trellis over a clean sheet of paper and wrote the secret message through the holes. There he removed the trellis and filled the rest of the paper with words that would make sense. When his friend received it, he put his trellis over the writing and read the secret message. Which of the following statements is TRUE?",Ciphers can be broken or figured out more easily than codes.,You could read some words in Geronimo's letter without his trellis.,The first person who ever used a cipher in history was Julius Caesar.,Fondness of using codes was the hobby of the scientists in the 1600s.,B

"Health insurance can be very expensive. Some working people do not make enough money to pay for it. In the US there is a program called Healthy Families. This program offers people health insurance at a low cost. Families are charged about Y=7.00 a month for every child, and Y=10.00 for every adult. It costs much less than any other kind of health insurance. Having health insurance is very important. With this insurance, people can see a doctor when they are sick or hurt. The program is not expensive at all, but many people are still not enrolling in it. People say that it still costs too much money. They need all of their money to pay for things like food and rent. It would be great if everyone could have health insurance. People are working hard to come up with ways to make this happen. One idea is to make the Healthy Families Program free for some people. It is important for people to see a doctor when they need to. The Healthy Families Program makes it possible for more people to do this. Many ideas are being considered. Hopefully some of them will allow even more families to get health insurance. The Healthy Families Program is made to help those who don't have welfare   and cannot earn enough to pay for private health insurance. It is an important program, but officials say that too many people are signing up for it and then dropping out because of the Healthy Families Program's cost. The aim of the Healthy Families Program is to   _  .",help people earn more and pay for the program,help more families get health insurance,make it free for people to see a doctor,help families pay for private health insurance,B

"An Australian company, Smart Car Technologies, has developed a system that lets drivers know when they're speeding. When the technology becomes commercially available, it could help lead-footed drivers avoid tickets and also save lives. The company that developed the product hopes to convince Australian government agencies to put the technology into use in their automobile fleets. The product, called Speed Alert, links real-time location data and speed obtained with the help of GPS to a database of posted speed limits stored in a driver's PDA or programmable mobile phone. The setup of the product does not need to be hooked up to a car's speedometer. In fact, it is entirely portable. It will also work with newer phones and PDAs that have built-in GPS receivers. If a driver exceeds the speed limit, the speed is shown and an alert sounds. Michael Paine, an Australian vehicle design engineer and traffic safety consultant, was hired to analyze the product. He told Live Science that his colleagues in the road safety field are ""very enthusiastic"" about what they're now calling ""intelligent speed alert."" Other research, according to Paine, shows that 40 percent of all traffic deaths involve speeding. There is also a potentially controversial future use: ""Since the system is so portable, it would be easy to make it a requirement for teenage drivers to always use a speed alert device when driving,"" Paine said. ""The system even has the capability to record speeding violations, so parents can monitor their teenage drivers."" The product will soon go on sale in Sydney. What's the purpose of the new product?",To inform us of the new car system.,To introduce some improvement in cars.,To limit certain drivers to safe driving.,To popularize the built-in car system.,C

"It is difficult for parents of nearly every family to teach their children to be responsible for housework, but with one of the following suggestions, you really can get your children to help at home. If you give your children the impression that they can never do anything quite right, then they will regard themselves as unfit or unable persons. Unless children believe they can succeed, they will never become totally independent. My daughter Carla's fifth - grade teacher made every child in her class feel special. When students received less than a prefect test score, she would point out what they had mastered and declared firmly they could learn what they had missed. You can use the same technique when you evaluate  your child's work at home. Don't always scold and give lots of praise instead.  Talk about what he has done right, not about what he hasn't done. If your child completes a difficult task , promise him a Sunday trip or a ball game with Dad. Learning is a process of trying and failing and trying and succeeding. If you teach your children not to fear a mistake of failure, they will learn faster and achieve success at last.

"Outside her cottage, old Mrs. Taylor was hanging out laundry on a wire line, unaware that some children were hiding in a nearby tree watching her every move. They were determined to find out if she really was a witch.  They watched nervously as she took a broomstick to sweep the dirt from her stone steps. But much to their disappointment, she didn't get on the broomstick and fly off. The old lady only looked up when her hen began to make sounds loudly --signaling that she had laid an egg in the nest on the top of the haystack. . The old lady put aside her broomstick and walked to the haystack, followed by Michael, a black cat she had rescued from a fox trap. With only three legs, it was hard for Michael to keep up with his mistress. The cat was proof for the children that only a witch would own a black cat with three legs! Crawling further along the branches, they could clearly see the haystack. Mrs. Taylor was standing on a wooden box with the new-laid egg in one hand. Placing the egg in her pocket, she readied herself to climb down. Then, without warning, the box broke under her and she crashed to the ground. The children were in horror. ""Should we go and help her?"" asked Mia. ""What if it's a trick?"" replied Patrick. ""She probably knows we're here. Witches know things like that!"" After thinking for a while, Julia said""Anyway, we should go and check whether she is all right."" Approaching _ , they could see a wound on the old lady's forehead. She had knocked her head on a stone and was unconscious. ""Go and get Dad,"" Mia yelled to her brothers. ""Tell him about the accident."" The boys didn't need another excuse to leave. They ran as fast as they could for help, hoping that Mrs. Taylor would not regain consciousness and turn the girls into frogs. Later, in the hospital, the old lady smiled her thanks.

"Ideas about education are changing in the United States. Education today is not just a high school diploma   or a college degree. Many adults are not interested in going to college. They are interested in other kinds of learning. For them, learning does not end with a diploma. Continuing education gives these adults the chance to increase their knowledge. It also gives them a chance to improve their old skills or to learn new ones. If they know more or learn more, then they can get a better job or earn more money.     There are usually a large number of classes to choose from. Some adults learn new skills. Some take classes for fun or because the class will be useful for them. Others take classes to improve their own lives because they want to feel better about themselves. And still others learn how to be good parents, or how to get along with other people. There are many chances for adults to continue their learning. Almost any community college or public school system has a continuing education program. There are classes in schools, buildings, or churches. Most classes are in the evening, so working people can attend. The classes are usually small, and they are inexpensive.

There are classes in schools, buildings, or churches. Most classes are in the evening, so working people can attend. The classes are usually small, and they are inexpensive. Thousands of people take continuing education classes each year. They receive no diploma and no grade for most of the classes they attend. For them, learning is something they do because they want to. We can infer from the passage that   _  .",college education is not important,adult education is very popular,other kinds of learning are more important than school learning,continuing education classes teach the same courses that are taught in colleges,B

"It takes more than just practice to become an Olympian. Gold medal performances require some serious nutrition. Have you ever wondered what these successful athletes eat to stay in peak shape? Keri Glassman, a registered dietitian and founder of Nutritious Life Meals, appeared on ""Good Morning America"" today to give you a glimpse into the diets of some top athletes. Some of their meals could surprise you. Crazy Calorie Count  _ One secret of swimmer Michael Phelps' astonishing performance in the 2008 Olympics in Beijing was consuming as many as 12,000 calories in one day. Athletes can eat like this and not gain any weight because their workouts are intense. According to Glassman, Phelps' workouts can burn 4,000 to 6,000 calories in a day, and those calories must be replenished   in order to train the following day. Snacking Secrets Some athletes eat wacky (strange, unusual) foods that they swear improve their performance. Yohan Blake, the Jamaica sprinter and 100-meter world champion, has been making waves for stealing champion sprinter Usain Bolt's thunder on the track during the Olympic trials. Asked about how he gets his stamina, Blake answered that he eats 16 bananas per day, Glassman said. Jonathan Horton, the lead gymnast on the US team, has a blood sugar problem. His solution is honey. When he starts to feel shaky at the gym, he takes swigs of honey to boost his energy, Glassman said. Foods for Recovery What are the best foods to help the body recover after rigorous (strict) competition? For Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte, the recovery meal is grilled chicken breasts with Alfredo sauce, whole-grain spaghetti and a salad with lemon juice and olive oil. Lochte, who recently cut out junk food, candy and soda, has undertaken a rigorous strength-training regimen  that involves flipping tractor tires, dragging shipyard chains and tossing beer kegs, Glassman said. What's the best title of this passage?",Good Diet Makes a True Olympian.,Olympians Have Olympic-size Appetites.,Olympians' Strange Eating Habits.,The Diets of some Top Olympic Athletes.,D

"My mind seems always to return to the day when I met Carl. The city bus stopped at a corner to pick up the daily commuters (someone who travels regularly to and from work), a group in which I was included. Boarding the bus, I looked for a place to sit. At last, I found a place near the back. The man in the seat next to the one I was going for was an older man in a grey suit, well-worn dress shoes, and a black hat like I always pictured reporters wearing, but without the little press card. Seated, I began to read the book I had been carrying, which was Jack Kerouac's On the Road. The man in the seat next to me introduced himself by asking if I had read any other book like the one I was holding. When I told him I had, he seemed to become interested, and so did I. He introduced himself as Carl and asked if I liked jazz, and I told him that I didn't really listen to it, and that I liked rock and roll. Waiting for Carl to tell me that I should listen to real music, I was shocked when he just smiled and nodded. He said, ""You remind me of myself when I was your age. I remember how my parents hated jazz and how they couldn't see how I could listen to that awful noise. I bet your parents say the same thing, don't they?"" Now it was my turn to smile, amused with how right he was. As the bus carried us from one side of the city to the other, Carl and I talked about a lot of different things. The more we talked, the more amazed I became at how much the two of us really had in common, despite the age difference. I haven't seen him since we parted, but the thought of our connection that day rarely leaves my mind. Carl really made me think about how much we can learn from each other if we just break through the blocks between us we've got. I mean, I would have never thought before that day that I could have anything in common with someone so much older than I. But Carl taught me that no matter what we are, we are all just people, and that we should make an extra effort to try and get to know our neighbors and people we see every day, regardless of age, race, religion, sex, or anything else. If we all take the time to attempt to understand each other, I think that the world would be a much better place that we could share together, as humans. The author usually imagined a reporter as one who   _  .",liked jazz music,enjoyed talking with others,liked reading Jack Kerouac's works,usually wore a black hat and press card,D

"The first memory I have of him---of anything, really---is his strength. It was in the late afternoon in a house under construction near ours. The unfinished wood floor had large, terrifying holes whose big and opening darkness I knew led to nowhere good. His powerful hands, then age 33, wrapped all the way around my tiny arms, then age 4, and easily swung me up to his shoulders to command all I surveyed. The relationship between a son and his father changes over time. It may grow and flourish in mutual maturity. It may sour in hated dependence or independence. With many children living in single-parent homes today, it may not even exist. But to a little boy right after World War II, a father seemed a god with strange strengths and strange powers enabling him to do and know things that no mortal could do or know. Amazing things, like putting a bicycle chain back on, just like that, or building a hamster cage, or guiding a jigsaw so it forms the letter F; I learned the alphabet that way in those pre-television days. There were, of course, rules to learn. First came the handshake, a good firm squeeze accompanied by an equally strong gaze into the other's eyes. ""The first thing anyone knows about you is your handshake,"" he would say. And we'd practice it each night on his return from work, the serious toddler in the old Cleveland Indian's cap running up to the giant father to shake hands again and again until it was firm enough. One day, I realize now, there was a change. I wasn't trying to please him so much as I was trying to impress him. I never asked him to come to my football games. He had a high-pressure career, and it meant driving through most of Friday night. But for all the big games, when I looked over at the sideline, there was that familiar fedora . And by God, did the opposing team captain ever get a firm handshake and a gaze he would remember? Then, a school fact contradicted something he said. Impossible that he could be wrong, but there it was in the book. These accumulated over time, along with personal experiences, to strengthen my own developing sense of values. And I could tell we had each taken our own, perfectly normal paths. I began to see, too, his blind spots, his prejudices and his weaknesses. I never threw these up at him. He hadn't to me, and, anyway, he seemed to need protection. I stopped asking his advice; the experiences he drew from no longer seemed relevant to the decisions I had to make.  He volunteered advice for a while. But then, in more recent years, politics and issues gave way to talk of empty errands and, always, to illness. After much thought and practice "" You can do whatever you have to do."", one night last winter, I sat down by his bed and remembered for an instant those terrifying dark holes in another house 35 years before. I told my father how much I loved him. I described all the things people were doing for him. But, I said, he kept eating poorly, hiding in his room and violating the doctor's orders. No amount of love could make someone else care about life, I said; it was a two-way street. He wasn't doing his best. The decision was his. He said he knew how hard my words had been to say and how proud he was of me. ""I had the best teacher,"" I said. ""You can do whatever you have to do."" He smiled a little. And we shook hands, firmly, for the last time. Several days later, at about 4 A.M., my mother heard Dad shuffling about their dark room. "" I have some things I have to do,"" he said. He paid a bundle of bills. He composed for my mother a long list of legal and financial what-to-do's "" in case of emergency."" And he wrote me a note.

But there are concerns about China's research environment, which is known for lacking in encouraging independent thinking and inventiveness, and even high salary offers may not be attractive enough to overcome this. If China wants to become a major world creator, it is no good just seeking partnerships with top Western universities or gathering a group of well-educated people and telling them to think creatively.

"I do desire to help my Chinese students to find a better way of learning. I once divided my Chinese MBA students into six groups and set them an assignment: brainstorming on ""two-hour business plans"", for example: a restaurant chain. Originality would be valued most. As a result, five groups proposed projects for restaurant chains. The sixth showed a catering service. I couldn't help expressing my disappointment, though the time limit had been rather challenging. Those middle managers and financial analysts from state-owned enterprises and global companies were not untalented or without opinions, but they had been accustomed to an educational system that rarely rewarded critical thinking or Originality. Papers were often copied from the Internet and the Harvard Business Review. Students insisted that copying was a superior business strategy, better than inventing and creating. In China, you can see almost all kinds of products you can imagine have been made and sold, but so few well developed marketing and management minds have been produced that it will be a long time before most people in the world can name a Chinese brand!

"What is freedom? It seems like such a simple question. Freedom is being able to do what you want to do. Allow me to explain it. I'm tired of working for a living. I'd rather collect taxes. So that's what I'm going to do: collect a kind of tax. You are ordered to estimate your income from the past 12 months, and write me a check for 1%. I have provided a mailing address for this purpose on my contact page ... What? You have a problem with my plan? Oh, I see. If you have to send me a check for the tax, then I have hurt your freedom to spend that money as you see fit. We have a conflict! And our basic problem is: we cannot enjoy freedom at the same time; we must settle for a limit. But what limit? Libertarians   believe freedom should be based on self-control. They describe freedom as being able to do what you want to do as long as it doesn't influence the equal right of others to do what they want to do. That is, freedom is being able to do what you like as long as you do not harm another person's life, liberty or property. You can build a set of legal and ethical   rules on the principle of self-control, and libertarians do. Their request for self-control often becomes more important than common sense, or even freedom itself. The definition rules out the freedom to steal, murder, and so on. Otherwise, you can do whatever you want. There is no problem until you realize that taxation is theft, that war is murder, and that national service is a form of slavery. Since only the government has a legal right to use force, libertarians focus on making the government smaller, or even going without it. The libertarians' definition of freedom is thus freedom from the government. Isn't it ridiculous?

"The black and white bird came ashore on a beach in the south of the North Island nearly 4,000 miles away from its usual habitat. The creature's astonishing journey was witnessed by a woman walking her dog as the two-foot bird waddled out of the water in front of her. She said, ""It was out of this world to see it. It was this glistening white thing standing up on the sand and I thought I was seeing things."" The tale of the lost penguin is similar to the 2006 children's film Happy Feet, in which a young penguin finds himself far from home during a voyage of discovery. Conservationists believe it has completed an incredible journey for such a young bird -- it is estimated to be around 10 months old. The most likely explanation for its appearance in New Zealand is the hunt for food. Experts said it may also have rested on an ice floe   during its travels and was carried north for a great distance before it made a swim for dry land. Colin Miskelly, a curator of New Zealand Museum, said, ""They can spend months at a time in the ocean and come ashore only to moult (,)or rest."" Mr. Miskelly said the brave bird would have to find its way back south soon if it was going to survive. He said, ""It is probably hot and thirsty and has been eating wet sand."" ""It doesn't realize that the sand isn't going to melt inside it because they typically eat snow -- their only liquid."" -- it can inflict   painful bites if threatened. Which of the following is True of Paragraph 1?",A young penguin found himself far from home during a voyage of moulting.,A creature's astonishing journey was incredible in the north of the North Island.,A woman witnessed a 2 feet bird waddled in the children's film while walking her dog.,A penguin came ashore on a beach thousands of miles away from its habitate.,D

"It's exciting to imagine how future humans will have solved the problems we have now, or what amazing new inventions will make our lives more convenient and interesting.

"Before Alaska became part of the U.S., it had been owned by Russia. Trading posts and small settlements were scattered along the coast. The rest of land was left unexplored. The Russians were mainly interested in the wealth of furs from the vast herds of seals they found there. By the mid-1800's, most of the seal herds had been wiped out, and Russia no longer wanted to keep Alaska. William Seward, Secretary of State for President Johnson, believed the United States should buy Alaska from Russia. President Johnson wasn't so sure it was a wise way to spend U.S. money, but he agreed to let Seward discuss it with the Russians. Acting quickly, Seward made a deal. On March 30, 1867, he signed an agreement for the U.S. to pay seven million dollars for the land. Many people thought it was a foolish waste of America's money. They called the deal ""Seward's folly"". Then gold was discovered in Alaska and public opinion changed quickly. Seward did not live to see the true value of Alaska. He died in 1872, five years after making the purchase  . Each year, Alaska's natural resources  have brought in many times the $7,000,000 paid for it. Natural gas, coal, oil, lumber, seafood and other minerals, besides the gold first found, have made it a valuable addition to the United States.

"Nearly everyone agrees that money doesn't buy as much as it used to, no matter when you want to spend it. This is certainly true of the paper money that passes so quickly through one's hands. But what about coins that seem to do very little except stay in purses and pockets? Unlike notes, metal money becomes more valuable the longer it is held, especially if it is put away where it won't get scratched or worn. Why is this? One reason is that coins, being more durable, fall more readily into a category for collectors. Naturally, the rarer gold pieces must become more valuable as the price of this metal goes up. But, curiously, one of the rarest coins in the world is not made of gold, but of the relatively cheaper silver. In 1840, the United States mint   struck 19570 silver dollars. That is what its records show. Today only six of this original number remain and these are unlikely ever to reach the auction   market. So what happened to some 19564 large silver coins, not the easiest sort of things to lose? One of the more romantic theories is that they were part of the payment to Napoleon for the American land then known as Louisiana. But they never reached France. Somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico, the ship transporting them was sunk, either by a storm or by pirates. The probable answer to the mystery is that they were melted down -- since the silver value was greater than the actual value of the coin. What really happened to the rest will probably always remain a mystery. What is known is that whoever can come up with one will find himself instantly rich.

"Sea lions and seals may swim in cold ocean water, but even they get sometimes. Seeing an injured seal wrapped in a blanket at a marine  mammal center gave Haley Humes and Hayley Jeffries an idea for a special Girl Scout project. They decided to make blankets to keep injured animals warm. They would give these blankets to the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach, California. ""We knew we wanted to help animals,"" Haley said. ""We went to the center to ask questions about what they needed. They don't have a heated floor, and all the babies crowded together to stay warm."" Friends since kindergarten, Haley and Hayley made 12 blankets to keep the Marine Mammal Center's seals and sea lions warm. Using fun images like Winnie-the-Pooh, the girls took two hours to make each blanket. The first sea lion to test out a blanket looked pretty in pink. ""It was a sick baby and really liked it,"" Haley said. ""It curled up in it right away."" ""The blankets are beautiful and the animals love them!"" said the Mammal Center's Michele Hunter. ""It's nice to see children taking pride in their work and doing something to help animals."" During the project, the girls took dozens of pictures for the PowerPoint presentations they gave to Girl Scout leaders. Those presentations helped Haley and Hayley raise $250 to buy additional supplies the center needed. This was the first project the girls ever worked on and took months to plan and carry out. ""I learned that in order to make something happen, you have to take it slowly and step by step,"" Hayley said. Just as important, the girls discovered that two people really can make a difference. ""Knowing you're making a difference......with these animals is amazing,"" Haley said. ""It was like the animals became my new friends.""

She never bought things online,but when they were delivered as a gift,she jumped for joy. She could not believe that I had ordered these gifts for her despite her being not much positive about online shops. However,after she saw both the products,she was assured that these online gift shops sent the promised brands and products,she loved her new watch and handbag. After this experience she ordered a gift for her friend's wedding. She chose a gift basket that could be made according to her requirements. They sent a beautifully decorated basket with fine wines and chocolates. The basket was so artistically decorated that it became her friend's favorite gift.

"For many people, the story of cottages -- small vacation homes away from the city -- is a deeply personal one.

At that time, crowds of people were moving from family farms to cities. Naturally, these people often felt a _ for the natural beauty of the countryside. Frequently located near lakes, in the mountains of woods, cottages provided a perfect solution.

"About 10 years ago my daughter was about 2500 kilometers from Newcastle, and rang me one day crying because of an emotional problem she was facing. She was about 20, and in a town known as Ayrlie Beach in Northern Queensland. I asked her what it was that she needed most in that moment, and she replied that she needed support, and my arms around her would be the best thing that she could hope for! Because I couldn't do that in that exact moment, I asked her to describe her surroundings to me (I have  ly no idea 'why', at the time), and said that if she hadn't heard from me in about 30 minutes, she could ring me back. I asked her to stay exactly where she was. After hanging up the phone, I just sat for a few seconds. After only a very short time a phone number jumped into my head. I rang the number and it was a woman who had bought a house from me about 18 months previously, when I was working in Real Estate. My exact words to her were these, ""Oh, it's you Liz, I have no idea why I'm calling you in particular, but my daughter is in trouble in Ayrlie Beach, and I just got the thought to ring you and tell you that. Have you any idea why?"" ""It could be because my son lives there,"" says Liz. ""Oh really, that's got to be it,"" I said. ""Do you mind giving me his phone number, Liz?"" ""Of course not, and I can only hope that he can be of some help!"" I rang straight away (only about 5 minutes have passed since telling my daughter that somehow I'd get her help). Fortunately, he answered immediately, and I told him the story of who I was, and why I'd rung. I gave him the description of my daughter; where she was standing; and that she needed emotional support if he could find it in his heart to help out so unexpectedly like this. ""Oh yes, I can see her,"" he said...""she's right across the street from where I'm standing!"" He walked across the street and told my daughter that her Dad had sent him! Imagine that...she almost fainted: only about 10 minutes had passed since she had rung me! I believe that she said something like this, ""Wow, Dad's getting pretty good at this stuff!"".

"Gray hair is simply a part of the normal aging process, and the rate you go silver is genetically predetermined. Going gray is not associated with earlier death, and premature graying is not, generally speaking, a sign of an illness or ill health in younger adults. There are, however, some specific health conditions associated with gray or white hair, but for most of us, going gray is just a fact of life.  Hair color1 comes from the pigment melanin , which determines your individual shade. Hair without any melanin is pure white. The pigment is produced in cells called melanocytes, which inject pigment into the hair. At some point in everyone's lifetime, these cells slow down and eventually stop producing color1. Scientists have yet to identify the exact mechanism by which melanocyte cell death occurs.  A study of more than 4,000 women and men from 20 countries determined that about 75% of people between the ages of 45 and 65 have some gray hair. In general, people of European descent gray earliest followed by Asians and Africans. It's interesting to note that a lucky 1 in 10 has no gray hair by retirement age. Beginning at age 30, your chances of having gray hair go up 10-20% per decade.  It may feel like you have more grays after a stressful event, but that's probably because middle age is basically a series of anxiety-ridden events. Between working, raising kids, and caring for older parents, the ""sandwich"" years of 45-65 can be stressful, especially for women. They are also when we naturally start to look older.  At this point, there is still no silver bullet to keep away the grays. What would be the best title for this passage?",Going gray.,Tips to make hair color1 last,Why does hair turn gray?,Gray hair is in fashion.,C

"Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) suggests. The three-year project found that only 21 % of children aged 8 --12 were ""connected to nature"". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what ""connected               to nature"" actually means and then deve -loped a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1, 200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21 % of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This ""realistic and achievable"" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organization. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27 % of girls were at or above the ""realistic and achievable"" target, only 16 % of boys were at the same level. ""We need to understand these differences,"" Sue Armstrong Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC New. ""Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyze the data to find that out."" The report also stressed significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland.

Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what ""connected               to nature"" actually means and then deve -loped a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1, 200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21 % of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This ""realistic and achievable"" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organization. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27 % of girls were at or above the ""realistic and achievable"" target, only 16 % of boys were at the same level. ""We need to understand these differences,"" Sue Armstrong Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC New. ""Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyze the data to find that out."" The report also stressed significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. How did the RSPB assess the level of nature connection among children?",By doing an experiment.,By carrying out a survey.,By running a test.,By visiting wildlife.,B
"Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB (Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) suggests. The three-year project found that only 21 % of children aged 8 --12 were ""connected to nature"". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK.

"In a new picture book, a 66-year-old Beijinger recaptures the capital's Lunar New Year traditions for children. In the Chinese lunar calendar, the 23rd day of the 12th lunar month, which falls on Feb 11 this year, is the ""Little Chinese New Year"". Traditionally, people will set off firecrackers to bid farewell to the Kitchen God who returns to Heaven to report the activities of every household over the past year to the Jade Emperor. However, such customs have lessened with time in the city and might seem unfamiliar to children nowadays. In order to preserve traditions for the next generation, Yu Dawu, a 66-year-old painter, recently published a picture book, Spring Festival in Beijing, for children to see how people used to celebrate the Chinese New Year. Based on an essay by Lao She (1899-1966), one of the most significant writers in modern Chinese literature, the picture book starts from the first holiday, La Ba, the eighth day of the 12th lunar month of the past year, when tradition says people should eat _ made of eight ingredients to bring good fortune in the coming year. It concludes with the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first lunar month of the new year, which marks the end of the Spring Festival. In the book, Yu creates a local family of four who live in an ordinary quadrangle courtyard, and readers follow the family as it celebrates the festival traditions. ""I am an old Beijinger, so when I was drawing and painting for this book, the memories of childhood rushed into my mind,"" recalls Yu at a book-sharing party earlier this week.

"YOUR mom might cook a bowl of noodles for you on your birthday. But in the US, a mom makes a cupcake for her children on their birthday. Cupcakes are small, round cakes topped with frosting  . It has been an American tradition that moms bring cupcakes to the classroom to celebrate their child's birthday. But recently some doctors have called for this to be banned.

Some people eat only a little of the frosting every time, others have it all in just one bite. In recent years, eating a cupcake has become as _ as having a cup of Starbucks coffee. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton jokingly promised on a talk show that if she was elected president, she would give everyone a cupcake on her birthday.

"There was great interest when a big hole mysteriously appeared in the middle of a field. Engineers were called in to explain how it had got there. They offered various explanations but were not at all sure how the hole had been caused, it was thought that a large bomb which came suddenly exploded, but it was not possible to prove this. A simple, but highly improbable explanation was offered by a man who declares to know well about ""flying saucers""; the strange objects which are round in shape and are said to visit the earth from outer space. The man's explanation may have been nonsense  , but at least it was imaginative. At any rate, it was far more interesting than the one given by the army. After examining the ground carefully the man declared to have seen special marks on the soil quite near the hole, these, he said, could only have been caused by a flying saucer. Moreover the leaves on some bushes nearby had turned yellow because of a strange hot gas which had come from the saucer just before it landed. Even a small tree some way off appeared to have been burnt slightly. A small piece of metal found in the hole itself gave further proof that a strange object had been there. According to the man, it was quite clear that people from another world had been going around the earth trying to pick up information, when something had gone wrong. Because of this they had been forced to land in a field so that the damage could be repaired. The hole had been caused when the saucer struck the earth, while the strange marks nearby were made when it took off again. This, said the man, was the simplest explanation of how the hole had appeared. Judging from the interest the public took in the matter, there must be quite a few people who secretly believe or hope that this simple explanation is the true one.

"Dear Alice,     My name is Lisa. I have social anxiety, disorder and was wondering how it would be possible to see someone for help without my parents knowing about it. I know that they'd be anything but supportive. They would think I'm  ly out of my mind. The truth is, I've put off dealing with it, acting as if it'll just go away or that I'll outgrow it. But in reality, the older I'm getting, the worse I'm getting. I avoid as many social situations as I can. I completely panic when meeting new people, I only stay in classes that don't require any talking on my part. It seems the only place I'm actually happy is at home or with people that I've known all my life. Hope you can help!    Dear Lisa,     About 5 million Americans have some form of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia. While everyone experiences nervousness or fear in social situations to a certain extent, those with social anxiety disorder are weakened by their fear. They may have a constant, intense, and lasting fear of being watched and judged by others, or be terribly afraid of being embarrassed or laughed at by ways in which they behave. As you have described, this fear can prevent people with social anxiety disorder from doing everyday activities, such as going to school or work, and can become so much of a focus that they limit their socializing.     It's understandable that you are worried about how your parents might react to knowing what's been going on for you. Many people think that their families will blame them for how they're feeling or _ their concerns. Being honest with your parents, however, might help you to feel more at ease; it's possible that they've noticed your behavior and wondered about it, or even struggled with similar feelings themselves. There's even some evidence that anxiety disorders may be genetic or run in families --perhaps due to environmental factors and patterns expressed through interpersonal interactions.

"Everybody has one of those days when everything goes wrong. This is what happened to Harry. He got up one morning very late because he had forgotten to wind up his alarm clock . He tried to shave quickly and cut himself. When he got dressed he got blood all over his clean shirt, so he had to find another one. The only other shirt that was clean needed ironing , so he ironed it. While he was ironing it, there was a knock at the door. It was the man to read the electricity meter . He showed him where the meter was, said good-bye and found that the iron had burnt a hole in his shirt. So he had to wear the one with the blood on it after all. By this time it was very late, so he decided he couldn't go to work by bus. He telephoned for a taxi to take him to work. The taxi arrived and Harry got in and began to read the newspaper.

"The canopy, the upper level of the trees in the rain forest, holds too much of climbing mammals   of moderately large size, which may include monkeys, cats, civets, and porcupines. Smaller species, including such as nice and small squirrels, are not as common overall in high tropical canopies as they are in most habitats globally. Small mammals, being warm blooded, suffer hardship in the exposed and uncertain environment of the uppermost trees. Because a small body has more surface area per unit of weight than a large one of similar shape, it gains or loses heat more rapidly. Thus, in the trees, where protection from heat and cold may be scarce and conditions may be changeable, a small mammal may have trouble maintaining its body temperature. Small size makes it easy to scramble among twigs   and branches in the canopy for insects, flowers, or fruit, but small mammals are defeated, in the competition for food, by large ones that have their own strategies for browsing among tbod-rich twigs. The weight of an ape hanging below a branch draws the leaves down so that fruit-bearing leaves drop toward the ape's face. Walking or leaping species of a similar or even larger size access the outer twigs either by breaking and gaining the whole branch or by catching hold of hard branches with the feet or tail and picking food with their hands. Small climbing animals may reach twigs readily, but it is harder for them than for large climbing animals to cross the wide gaps from one tree top to the next that typify the high canopy. A gibbon can hurl itself farther than a mouse can: it can achieve a running start, and it can more effectively use a branch as a springboard  . The forward movement of a small animal is seriously reduced by the air friction   against the  ly large surface area of its body. Which of the following questions does the passage answer?",How is the rain forest different from other habitats?,How does an animal's body size influence an animal's need for food?,Why does rain forest provide an unusual variety of food for animals?,Why do large animals tend to dominate the upper canopy of the rain forest?,D
"The pomegranate is one of the oldest known fruits. Pomegranates are found in ancient writings and pictured in the ancient art of many cultures and religions. The pomegranate is also a symbol of health, fertility and long life. Experts think the pomegranate is native to northern India, Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan.
